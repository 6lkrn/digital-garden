# Black Sails

  

Black Sails centers around a region of the world colonized by the major continental nations far across the vast sea. This new world teems with life and resources and the various colonial interests have wasted no time in setting up many colonies upon the islands. In addition to their soldiers, materiel and populations, the colonial powers have also imported their rivalries and intrigue from their homelands.

  

Now, these colonials search the new lands far and wide for resources and the vast treasures of ancient empires. These lands offer new mysteries to explorers willing to brave the dangers and exotic goods to those willing and able to ship them back to their homelands.  
  

However, it is the trade routes of these Golden Seas that are the most valuable and the colonial powers do everything they can to protect the seas and the profitable trade that sails upon it.

  

But the seas are treacherous and no danger is greater than that of the various pirate bands that ply the waters looking for weak ships and ports to plunder. With ships bearing black sails, their ships mercilessly prey on those unlucky enough to be caught in their sights. Their presence has made protecting the Colonial ships a high priority.

  

Sail the seas if you dare. It may not be today, or tomorrow, but one day, the Black Sails will come for you.

  
  
  

## The Colonial Powers

  

There are four primary colonial powers that have staked a large claim to the islands of the Golden Seas of the new world. Other colonial powers exist as well, but have a lesser influence in the region.

  

### Albion

  

Ruled by Her Royal Highness Catherine IV, Albion is an island kingdom that excels as a naval and colonial power. Once at the mercy of raiders from other parts of the continent, the Albion people embraced the protection of the ancient Silver Dragon known as Brightscale. For many years, the dragon has protected the land from raiders and invasions allowing the nation to grow and prosper.  Albion is also home to the powerful North Continental Trading Consortium and the partnership between the two has made both parties extremely powerful and wealthy. Real world equivalent: England, Scotland and Ireland.

  

Colonies of Albion

  

Queensport

Queensport is probably Albion’s most important port in the Golden Seas, home to its central governance as well as the central port for the mighty Albion Dragon Fleet. From here, Albion’s unmistakable dragonships set sail to enforce their influence on the Golden Seas. Queensport is also home to the North Continental Trading Consortium central colonial office as well as home to the Tower of the Navigator’s Guild.

  

Governor William Morgan, decorated soldier and notorious pirate hunter, governs Queensport with an iron fist. He also commands a special fleet of ships known collectively as the Sea Dragons. The Sea Dragons are tasked with hunting down and destroying all pirates in the Golden Seas.

  

Covington

Covington is a merchant port, a stopping point where goods from the new world are loaded onto ships bound for Albion as well as goods arriving from Albion for trade with Ixacha. Naturally, the port is protected by the Dragon Fleet.

  

Port Valor

Port Valor is primarily a military installation, hosting a vast number of marines and troops on the coast of ancient Tsu-Mana. From here, various expeditions into the varied Tsu-Mana ruins originate. However, there is a merchant presence as well, bringing supplies and goods to the troops of Port Valor and collecting the spoils of expeditions to Tsu-Mana.

  

### Macaria

  

The Kingdom of Macaria is one of the oldest on the Continent, its past deeply rooted in the ancient Caelium Empire.  Ruled by King Carlos de Salvarino de Maravilloso, Macaria has enjoyed the prosperity that comes from a powerful naval fleet as well as a profitable trade industry. Macaria was one of the first continental nations to establish a colony in the Golden Seas and, as such, is the only colonial power that enjoys a favorable relationship with the Ixachan Empire.  Real world equivalent: Spain, Portugal and Italy.

  

Colonies of Macaria

  

Puerto Diamante

The oldest of Macaria’s colonies, Puerto Diamante is a bustling port city. Many profitable trades and adventures originate in Puerto Diamante, owing mainly to the looser governing policies of its governor. The port city is also home to the Temple of the Faith, the largest temple to the gods of the colonial faith.

  

Zafiro

The only foreign port city on the southern continent, Zafiro enjoys the benefits of trade with the strange jungle empire of Ixacha. From here, Macarian merchants ply foreign goods in exchange for the exotic goods the Ixachans provide.

  

Amatista

Another major Macarian port for trade, Amatista is also home to a great number of Macarian nobles who crossed the ocean to set up new business or to just have a foreign estate they could brag about to their rivals back home. This, of course, has made Amatista a prime target for thieves and pirates to unburden an unsuspecting noble of their money and valuables.

  
  

### Flore

  

Flore is a magocracy, ruled by a council of wizards known as Le Conseil. Their interest in the new world is not centered around trade, but the recovery of ancient magical artifacts. To that end, they have established an operation of tomb raiders and ruin explorers to scour the new world. They have taken a particular interest in the Tsu-Mana ruins and often find themselves competing with the North Continental Trading Consortium.  Real world equivalent: France.

  
  

Colonies of Flore

  

Cassis

Cassis is the Florian seat of power in the new world. Over one hundred years ago, Le Conseil constructed their massive tower, dubbed La Fleche, at the center of the island.  Subsequently, the Florians then built an entire colony around the tower. Cassis also houses the Florian military as well as their powerful eldritch knights, their dreaded Chevaliers.

  

Nevis

By all accounts, Nevis is yet another Florian colony of no particular interest.  Despite its unremarkable reputation, Nevis is protected by a magical weather system that ensures that only authorized vessels are allowed to dock in its port.  This has spawned many rumors and legends, most holding that Le Conseil conducts dark and twisted magical experiments deep within their island stronghold.

  

Ancien 

The port colony of Ancien is a converted Tsu-Mana ruin, its treasures and magics plundered a hundred years ago by a Florian expedition. Now, Ancien is a staging ground for further Conseil expeditions into the jungles of ancient Tsu-Mana.

  
  
  

### Motungo

  

The Empire of Motungo lies far to the east of the new world, on the western coast of the lands known to the Continentals as The Fire Lands. It is primarily a tropical and jungle empire, however it has provinces that reach as far as the continent’s northern deserts as well. Ruled by “The Red Lion” King Mansa, Motungo has increased its influence as a Continental rival by establishing its own colonies in the new world using its unusual fleet of living ships.  Built from living trees magically altered to live using sea water, Motungo ships are a wonder to behold.  The Sea Shamans, a sect of Motungo druids, act as both pilots and caretakers. No pirate has ever been able to raid, board, or steal one of these magnificent ships. It is said that the ships themselves rebel against any intrusion.  

  

Motungo society is divided into a caste system, divided into the following strata: Enghela (Noble), Umpristi (Priest), Ibutho (Warrior), Wizadi (Mages), Isisebenzi (Worker), Ncheku (Slave), and Isela (The Downcast, Those of the Shadows) Real world equivalent: West Africa, Mali, Morocco.

  
  

Colonies of Motungo

  

Bandari

Home of Ingane, the Child Tree, Bandari was built around a transplanted sapling of the Omkhulu, the Great Tree of Motungo.  It took only twenty years of nurturing for the sapling to grow into a massive tree that shelters the entire city. The Overhang, buildings grown out from the branches, are home to the city’s Enghela caste.

  

Kitropiki

Another Motungo colony, Kitropiki consists of vast farm estates, cultivating great amounts of foodstuffs native to the region for export to Motungo and other ports. Delicacies produced here are in high demand the world over.

  

## Other Lands

  

### Ismark

  

A country in the cold north of the Continent, [[Root/Worlds/Barovia/NPCs/Ismark Kolyanovich\|Ismark]] has not yet extended its influence across the ocean to the Golden Seas. Many from [[Root/Worlds/Barovia/NPCs/Ismark Kolyanovich\|Ismark]], however, have decided to brave the heat and danger and bought passage on other nations’ ships to seek fame and fortune.  Real world equivalent: Germany, Netherlands.

  

### Tung-An

  

The Celestial Empire of Tung-An rules the western ocean and has only begun to extend its reach to the Golden Seas, particularly interested in the natural sea passageway between the western ocean and the eastern ocean.  Real world equivalent: China.

  

### Kageshima

  

Although the island nation of Kageshima is but a minor naval power in the western ocean, it possesses great power as a financial powerhouse due to its ruthless Kage, a feudal nobility that control virtually all the mercantile and criminal enterprises in their region. The Kage houses may feud among themselves, however the lure of business and promise of great profit oftentimes reduces animosity if everyone benefits.  Real world equivalent: Feudal Japan.

  

### Uraka

  

Not much is known about the dark land of the Orcs that lies far to the east of Motungo. However, their outcasts, the half-orcs of the world, often make their way across vast oceans and seas to seek a better living.

  

## Other Places of Note

  

### The Free City of Paradesos

  

Ruled by the great (and reclusive) Red Dragon Syrroloth, Paradesos (named after the capital of a city lost to time) exists as a free bastion where anything and anyone is welcome. Order is maintained by Syrroloth’s Fire Guard, red-clad soldiers and priests who maintain the peace. Anyone who violates the Dragon’s Peace is executed in the great arena for the amusement of all who pay to enter. It is said that the most vile of offenders meet their end at the talons of Syrroloth herself.

  

### The Blackport 

  

Known to the free folk of the Golden Seas as The Slaver’s Hole, the Blackport is the center of trade in slaves, beings unfortunate enough to be captured as part of raids or those sold into indentured servitude to pay off debts. A great number of Kenku are enslaved as well, turning the otherwise colorful and energetic indigenous bird-peoples into dark reflections of themselves.

  
  

### The Ixachan Empire

  

Ixacha is a vast jungle empire on the land mass to the south of the Golden Seas. Though considered primitive by the Colonial powers, the Ixachan empire is quite formidable in its own right. Real world equivalent: Ancient Aztec Empire.

  
  

### The Yanaha Tribes

  

Tribes of elves from the land mass north of the Golden Seas, the Yanaha Tribes roam their lands and treat intruders with hostility.  They possess great powers over nature, their druids among the strongest in the world. The colonial powers have thus far decided to leave them alone, although it is said that some [[Root/Worlds/Barovia/NPCs/Ismark Kolyanovich\|Ismark]] colonies exist far to the north.

# Legends and Lore

  

### The Huntmaster

  

Sailing the seas, bringing freedom and beer to all the downtrodden, is the Huntmaster. Once a pirate, the Huntmaster was betrayed by his crew and cast down and enslaved. It is said that he is immortal, and that he wields an iron tankard that never runs out of ale. He seeks revenge on those that betrayed him.

  

### The Sea Wolves

  

The Sea Wolves are notorious pirates who hound the shores near Ixacha, raising the ire of the Macarian colonies. It is said that they are commanded by Esmerelda, a female pirate of astounding beauty, intelligence and cunning, but no one who has encountered them has ever returned to tell the tale.

  

### The Leviathan

  

The Leviathan is a massive galleon (made up of two galleons lashed together with magics) and is captained by an Illithid named Sovok.  The Leviathan, for the right price, will transport goods safely and promises to be pirate-proof. To date, no pirate has successfully gone against the Leviathan and lived.

  

### Barrett’s Privateers

  

Barrett’s Privateers are a pirate band that hounds all Albion ports and has made themselves the mortal enemy of Governor Morgan.  Led by Nathaniel Barrett, the Privateers are slippery and cunning and have managed to stay alive despite their many run-ins with Morgan’s Sea Dragons. Whom they serve is a subject of much speculation and mystery for only a powerful nation could be responsible for outfitting and funding their operation.

  

### The Navigator’s Guild

  

A powerful cadre of mages who hire themselves out (extremely expensively) as ship navigators. They use their magic to navigate the seas safely and efficiently, allowing ships to avoid dangerous waters and move through treacherous storms with ease.
