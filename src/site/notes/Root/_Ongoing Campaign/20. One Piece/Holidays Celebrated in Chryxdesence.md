Chryxdesence balances the influence of the empire and their own local culture to support a mix of holidays. 
## God Emperor’s Crowning

This is a day commemorating the formation of the empire and the ascension of the emperor of the world government. The celebrations were focused in the port town of Chryxtalia. Where people would gather around with their own caricature and statues of the emperor and parade them all around time. It starts from sunrise to sunset.  At midnight the busts and statues would be lit up to signify the fact that even in darkness, the emperor’s guiding light still shines. It is celebrated on the first day of the year.
## Ancestor’s Landing

The spirits always remember the day of the progenitor’s landing quite fondly. They would make it a point for the upcoming generation to remember it well. Therefore all of the island’s inhabitants would gather around the hidden protected cove where stories of their progenitor made landfall and cleansed the lands. Everyone would bring their own food and share with one another. Generally home cooked foods were brought up here. The walls of the very cove and entrance into the cave connecting the sea and the land were decorated with colorful murals depicting the events of the landing. It is noted that the murals glow in the dark of night. It is celebrated on the middle of the third month.
## Firstborne’s Steps

When the ancestor’s fell in battle to beat back the spores and miasma, they were all interred in the peat and moss. From the very dirt, grew sprouts that birthed the firstborns. The very first generation of the Chryxseelie and the Beastkin. The inhabitants of the island would gather on the mass nursery and the spirits would retell of the stories of each Firstborn. What they represent of the future and the contributions of the past ancestors. The day was celebrated on the first day of the last month of the year.
## Spirits’ Grace

This celebration was started by the firstborns. It was only fair to commemorate the spirits for what they have done all this time for the people of the home island. Notably, it was the only time where the Aurai would grace the people of the home island with their presence. Playing along with the rituals and revelry. Here the people would meet with the spirits to give them gifts and thanks. Mostly it was done by leaving the gifts near rivers, hanging on trees and the sea. Easy places for the spirits and nymphs to pick up. For the rare few that would be able to commune with the nymphs and spirits, they would personally meet with them and deliver their gift and thanks in person. This day is celebrated on the final day of the 9th month of the year.

## Kindred’s Remembrance

The disparity among the people in the home island’s populace was hard to not see. Though for the inhabitants this could not be further from the truth. They were all in a way, the same. All of them were descended from the firstborns that were birthed from the pods that sprouted from peat and moss. The celebration spans about 2 days. Plenty enough for people to visit their friends and family to celebrate together. Here they would do the ritual of asking forgiveness and organizing feasts for their guests that came to their doorsteps. It was celebrated on the middle of the 5th month.
## Culling Call

The miasma was not something stagnant. It is like a massive creature that constantly birth abominations from the living being that fell to their control. The frequency of the call varies on the state of the Miasma and Spore itself. Sometimes it would not happen for a year or two, at its most active, the call would happen almost every 3 months. It was a right of passage for the inhabitants of Chryxdesence. Each and everyone of them would participate in the Festival one way or the other. The things they saw and learn amidst the festival would give them better understanding on the process of Miasma and Spore. The spirits and the dryads would be seen in the middle of the town to announce the need of the Culling. Upon announcement, the inhabitants would use up to 2 days to get their dealings in order.
