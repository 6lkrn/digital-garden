The Dread Sea Info

The Dread Sea is an area beyond any known maps of the normal world, a region of shifting waves and mysterious happenings, it is theorized  that the barriers between all the other planes are weaker here, leading to strange phenomenon and dangerous storms. This is a playground for demons, angels, elementals, fey, and darker creatures... 

 There was once a Great Kingdom out  in the waves, but it is gone now, reduced to ruins at  the bottom of  the sea. The mainland military lost contact with all bases  in the area around 70 years ago, unbeknownst  to them,  their naval presence is strong but completely isolated from higher  command and has essentially become its own entity. There are reported to be a scattering of islands, sparsely populated. Adventurers travel there to earn their stripes, and innkeepers follow.  

Notable NPCs are the crew of the Salted Whisker, a band of Charismatic Tabaxi Pirates*.

- The Captain, Cara-Cara in the Grass a fluffy caramel-colored cat, who dual wields scimitars (trans man)
    
- Dartmoth Mistletoe a fuzzy brown cat with yellow eyes, and a harmonica
    
- Pinetree shooting-star a white cat with blue eyes, 
    
- Indie Jones, a heavy set grey tabby, 
    
- First Mate Nakita Athena, sister of Cara-Cara, looks almost identical but is far more serious than her brother
    
- Big Gyppers, a loud and affectionate Long Haired black tabaxi
    
- Yeti Stove a Maine coon with a white underbelly, young, but extremely talk\l and very awkward
    
- Chipp the Monger, a black and white Persian with two eyepatches he flips up as necessary eyepatch and crutches
    
- Clem Fandango all-black shorthair, Clemfandango is impossible to find, unless his name is spoken, In which he pops out of random locations and says: “hi, Clemfandango here!” and then disappears. Possibly a trickster god in disguise
    
- Samuel Seabreak, a young very anxious tabaxi siamese.
    

They are sworn enemies  to the Navy, and Captain Martin, a mousefolk captain of the Pearl of Lutra. 

*Note, it is up to you how “piratey” you want the salted whisker crew to be, they could be villains in disguise, an encounter, the crew your party travels with to keep things running, its up to you!

Prismatic Hot Spring resort

Play lofi legend of Zelda while they are inside cause vibes

This hotspring is located on an island in the Dread Sea.It is an island where the veil between the material plane and the feywild is blurred, creating a space of surprisingly peaceful magic  It is run primarily by Naiads and Dryads, the island itself is heavily wooded, and covered in crystals and bioluminescent plants, large crystal formations and geodes dot the landscape butterflies and dragonflies float lazily through the air, keen eyed adventurers may also notice fairy dragons, from as small as a fly to as large as a cat, throughout the complex, chickens walk leisurely around the complex, and parrots and hummingbirds are common. Sprites and pixies fill the air, and at night intermingle with the fireflies. Deer, their antlers covered in vines, and their tiny fauns, walk quietly through and tropical plants bloom year round, at night the waves become  glowing blue as luminescent algae glows under the moonlight. There are more stars in the sky here than you’ve ever seen in your entire life. At night the air fills with fireflies, which are released from the lanterns they are kept in. It is always the full moon here.

A few smaller boats are tied along the beach, and a bamboo walkway leads guests inside, where a Naiad attendant named Vattna waits, she explains that the guests need to take a shower first, and then go into the first spring to acclimate, but after that they have full access to the entire island complex, the complex is made mostly of bamboo and natural stone, once inside, it is steamy  warm and humid, and strings of lanterns dip across the moss paths, tied tree to tree. There are hammocks everywhere,

The Golden Gull

# The Golden Gull is run by a half orc Aasimar named Garth Obero (Please don’t sue me Brennan Lee Mulligan). He runs essentially a fantasy opium den filled with various hookahs with different magical effects Garth himself does not . You can make up your own effects, but I will be using those featured here: [http://dndspeak.com/2020/08/19/100-mushrooms-and-their-effects/](http://dndspeak.com/2020/08/19/100-mushrooms-and-their-effects/). A few patrons dot the various lounges, Major, a dark skinned human with dreadlocks,  

# Oddity, Ocelot, and Outdated Gowns.

Oddity, Ocelot, and Outdated Gowns, (or OOO for short) is a thrift store and tailor shop, run by Wesley the tiefling, and his pet talking Ocelot. The front of the store is run by the Ocelot, named Ozzy, it is set up like a regular thrift shop, with high shelves, and cluttered with many random objects that have ended up here one way or another including a large section of books, and random items 

 [http://dndspeak.com/2018/05/16/200-parody-books/](http://dndspeak.com/2018/05/16/200-parody-books/) 

[http://dndspeak.com/2018/02/16/100-items-in-a-fantasy-thrift-shop/](http://dndspeak.com/2018/02/16/100-items-in-a-fantasy-thrift-shop/)  
Ozzy will not immediately speak to the party, but instead just watch. Its a trick him and wesley use to see if there are shoplifters. The back of the shop is entirely different, through a set of gossamer curtains is the tailors shop, filled with plants, water features, and soft music, it is run by Wesely, a sunset colored tiefling making quality fashion. I’m using this list, reflavoring anything I need.

[http://dndspeak.com/2019/05/03/elven-clothing-accessories-descriptions/](http://dndspeak.com/2019/05/03/elven-clothing-accessories-descriptions/)   

There are no other customers in  the shop besides a beautiful goblin woman getting fitted by wetley in a suit. Her name is Palma.

  
  
  
  

Encounters 

  

The Witch King's tomb

Long  ago this was a large tomb peeking out of the ocean, but time has worn it down and now only a Sandbar with a few columns and steps leading down remain… The witch queen made two tombs, both puzzle dungeons, to honor her fallen lover, 

The first hall 

This hall is empty except a single Pyre of blue flame and a torch with an inscription in Primordial and common: 

the first flame, its light burns the way,

 the walls are decorated with 5 tapestries, there are solid walls behind them. Each showing a different moment from a king's life. 

1- The kings birth,

A great Eagle drops a baby from the gods above into the waiting arms of an elated king and queen, standing in front of a palace

2-The Kings Coronation

The king is kneeling as an ancient god blesses him as crowds cheer, a woman stands next to him, wearing a crown and holding a sword.

3-The Eternal flame

This shows the king lighting the blue flame, if the characters light this tapestry, it reveals a secret passageway that would not have been shown otherwise.

4-The scholarly

This shows the king pouring over books, while the woman with the sword fights below him

5-Death,

This tapestry shows 3 scenes, the king lying dead, the queen constructing two giant pyramids in the sea, and the King being buried in one.

The second hall

The second hall is a long corridor filled with doors, 11 in all, and the wall is covered in depictions of gods, all of the doors are fake and opening them will make everyone in a 10 foot radius make a dex save DC13 or take 4d4 force damage or half on a success  

To unlock the real door they must press the right part of the right god, There are 12 gods each connected to part of the Zodiac and each has a different roman numeral. From the left wall closest to the entrance to right:

- Capricorn I, A goat with the bottom half of a fish, its hoof on a scroll

-Aquarius III, a woman standing on a mountain, pouring water off the side to fill the rivers 

- Pisces VI, a merman with musical notes and paint stroke swirling around him

- Aries IV, a woman in armor with ram horns, tending a fire

- Taurus II, a minotaur with a shield

-Gemini,  a two-faced god, Janus, holding a clock with XII, pressing the 12 on the clock reveals the 12th door, the real door.  

-Cancer VII, A giant crab standing as protector over a city.

-Leo IX, a man with a lion head holds a shield over children's head to save them from arrows

-Virgo VIII, a woman holds a branch with the same fruit from the primordial tree as she rises out of the waves.

-Libra V, a blindfolded man holding scales

- Scorpio XI, A figure with the claws and tail of a scorpion attacks an army.

-Sagittarius X, A centaur aims an arrow towards the sky

DC 11 perception to see the roman numerals

DC 16 Religion to identify Janus

DC 7 insight or perception to realize there are 11 doors and 12 gods

The Third Hall

A once beautiful room covered in dust, beautiful murals cover the walls, 6 in all, and a door at the end which is locked by all means but speaking the code word, KRAKEN, into the keyhole. The inscription above the door reads in common and primordial:

“In order to gain all knowledge, one must know where to start. Count, on those around you to reveal the source of the secret, and let their names whisper the key to you.”

The modification of the painting Puzzle, from Tashas cauldron of everything, page 172, go there for more tips and clues.

6 murals line the walls, each corresponding to a letter from left to right the murals are:

1- 5 Ents, in a forest grove

2- 4 Kobolds, dancing around a fire

3- 2 Redcaps, sneaking through a swamp

4- 3 Alicorns, flying through the clouds

5- 6 Nyads, dancing in a spring

6- 1 Kitsune, setting up for tea

KRAKEN

The players must count how many of each creature there are, and then that is the placement of the first letter of the creature in the codeword. 

DC 11  intelligence check to realize the importance of  the word count. 

DC 15 intelligence to realize the names hold some significance  

If they still dont understand  then a DC 17 check to realize the number of figures in the painting  is significant.

  
  

The Kings Tomb

The Kings tomb is a large room with a raised coffin with a statue of the queen weeping, lying atop it. Behind the coffin is a giant statue, that smiles warmly down at the adventurers an inscription at his feet reads: 

“Let the warmth of companionship offer a breath of fresh air, as nothing is more valuable than the hand of another.”

There is a glowing blue gem sitting in the hand of the weeping queen, if they players take it, or try to leave the room, the doors close and the room begins to fill with water, start a timer for 10 minutes, which is how long the players have until the room fills up. The gem is magical, whoever holds it can breathe underwater, anyone holding their hand or touching them can breathe as well, once everyone is holding hands, the water drains and the witch king appears, his spirit congratulates them and tells them that his wife's spirit is trapped, entombed in  her own despair, and that if the adventurers travel through her tomb and free her as well, he will be grateful, although he does not know what they will face, it is likely to be far more dangerous. Once the kings ghost appears, he will explain that the  gem will lose its magical powers the moment it leaves the room, however, he believes there is a place within his wife's tomb where they can repower it to it’s true power. He does not know where the queen's  tomb is, but he believes it to be north of here, giving the party advantage on nav checks to find it. If the  party does not activate it, it is a non-magical gemstone worth 300gp

  

The Witch Queens Tomb

A rocky outcrop with damp cold stairs leading down into the depths…

First Hall 

The first hall is dark  with empty schones for torches, a wide chasm filled with grey mist at the bottom, with a door on the other side, a pedestal reads:

“Put your faith in the gods above, to unlock the treasure below. What lies ahead is for the brave, so prove your unguarded worth..

There is no turning back.”

The door is fake, the chasm is 10 feet wide and bottomless, if the players try to  open the door in any way it will not work, and trying to climb down using ropes or the chasm walls, the mist stops them. The only way to solve the puzzle is to jump into the chasm completely untethered. In which as they fall down, they will begin falling up, and fly into an exact copy of the original room, brightly lit, with a real door leading deeper and a chasm that only goes a few feet deep. _Bring the player aside if they jump, and describe what they see, as once they jump, they cannot  get back or communicate even by sending with their companions_

The real door will lead them further in…

Hints: DC 10 perception: the word below implies the chasm is involved

DC 17 intelligence or perception and the word unguarded sticks out to you

Second Hall

 A hallway with torches burning blue fire mounted along one wall, with an unlit brazier at either end, no visible exit,  and the door disappears once you enter. There are 10 torches in all, 1 being a  fire elemental, 4 being fire snakes , 2 being fire sprites, 2 being harmless flame and only 1 will light the magical brazier the order goes:

1-Snake

2-Snake

3-Fire Sprite

4-Elemental

5- Random flame

6-random flame

7-Real Flame

8-Snake

9-Fire Sprite

10-Snake

A riddle on the opposite wall of the torches reads:

  

“Only one will light your path,

Choose wrong to face fires wrath

Two of these torches hide a sprite

Ready to kill, filled with spite

Two of these torches are harmless sparks

Their empty promise beconds and harks

Four among are filled with Snakes

Fueled by fire and cursed to wake

One alone holds a spirit of Flame

Ready to kill, unable to tame,

And one more still holds your key, 

To find the truth, hear their plea:

One and Two are sisters, 

Three and Nine as well

You will find the harmless burn together

spirit and the Key as guarding flames

the Snakes and Sprites stay by the others side. 

A snake guards the Key, standing by

In number Three a sprite you’ll find

Hasten now and reveal truth undenied.”

  

Once the correct flame is brought to the brazier, a door burns into existence at  the end of the hall, for the players to walk through

Third Hall

The third hall is a small room, two statues of Gorgons, an outline of a trapdoor on the floor, one corridor leading right to the fourth hall, a locked door, that leads to the seventh hall and a stone pedestal, with stairs leading up to it, with the imprint of a hand. If the players try to place their hand on the outline, the outline will magically change so it does not fit. They will have to go through the 6th hall to unlock this room. Once a stone hand is placed in the indentation, the door in the floor will become real, and unlock, revealing a ladder going  deeper

  

Fourth Hall

This hall is a large empty room with a smooth floor on the other side there is a door, about 15 feet up the wall, once  the players reach the center of the room, their feet are glued to the floor and water begins to pour in, and a hidden inscription glows and reads:

“Your regrets have weighed you down, set them free to free yourself.”

Start a stopwatch, for each minute that passes the room fills with another foot of water, to free their feet, they must each reveal a regret to the room, once a player has done so, their feet are released and they float to the top, if a player cannot come up with something  before the water covers their head and they will drown without magical water breathing aid. Once everyone is free, they can float to the next door

Fifth Hall 

This room is small, the door closes behind them, with a single pedestal in the center with stairs leading up to it, and a door when inspected is unlocked and leads to the 6th hall. The pedestal has gorgon heads carved into all sides, all crying blood, filling an indentation in the pedestal, at the bottom of the indentation is another outline of a hand, is at the bottom of the pool, the hand will turn to stone, and become the key to the third Hall. 

Sixth Hall 

Once entering the Sixth hall the door closes behind them. The Sixth hall is a large 18x18 square foot room, with nine tiles in the middle and a locked door, if a player stands on a tile, a different tile lights up, the room is playing a game of tic tac toe with the players, once they win, the door will unlock. Leading back to the 3rd hall

 Seventh Hall

It  takes about 60 feet of ladder to drop down into the 7th hall. The Seventh hallway is decorated with murals of the queens life, starting from closest to the players to farthest:

1-The queen being born, in a small shack with starving parents

2- War driving her away from her home, her parents dying and her as a child fleeing towards a kingdom

3- Her meeting the King, older, now a warrior, 

4- Their marriage scene

5- Her off fighting wars, the king in the background studying

6- The king falling ill, the queen weeping at his side, 

7-The King dies, and is carried into a great tomb while the queen watches

8-The queen building the second pyramid, her own tomb, overcome with guilt

9-A final scene of the queen in front of a statue of her beloved, stabbing herself with a sword. 

At the end of the hall is a door engraved it says:

“Such misfortune shadows my soul, speak his opponent and the door shall open”

Underneath that is a riddle:

“Four omens till death do they part

Red will ride through the land on steed

His wrathful stare, the world will bleed

White will fly through to collect the praise

All will wither under his gaze

Pale comes next to home and stead

Meet him sleeping in your bed

  

All but one I have recollected

Say his name to face my soul restored.”

The Queens Tomb

  

The queens tomb is less of a tomb and more of a prison. It is filled with rough carved stone, and is a stark contrast to the kings, against the  back wall is a life sized statue of the  king, and at his feet  is the mummified corpse of the queen sword still thrust through her. In his hands, is an octopus amulet, with a space large enough for the gemstone found in the kings tomb. If the stone is placed here, it becomes a stone of good luck

Once the  players place the stone in the hole, the corpse comes to life, the queen has become a revenant, with magic on her side, and the party must fight her to the death to release her spirit. The queen was a powerful witch in life, and has retained the ability to teleport. She can teleport as a bonus action and on a 5 or 6 on a d6, her ability to teleport recharges.

  

Tower of Mirrors 

The tower of mirrors is a mysterious monolith on a rocky outcrop in the middle of the sea, perhaps an ancient wizard lab, or something darker, this tower has  warped into a mirror zone (page 158 Tashas cauldron) and has become a trap for unwary adventurers, reflecting their darkest secrets, weaknesses, or fears.

Entering

The outside of the tower is 60 feet tall pitch black, a stark contrast against the sky, there is a single door at the bottom that the players can enter in from, the inside of the tower is pitch black, until the  entire party enters, in which light fills it and the door disappears, then they see  the true nature of the interior 

  

Inside

As soon as The tower's interior  is completely coated in mirrors, floor to ceiling. A winding spiral staircase leads to the top  where light shines down from an open door, the only exit. If the party decides to travel up (not that they have a choice) about halfway up, have everyone make a DC 17 perception check, anyone who succeeds notices that their reflection doesn’t match up. At this point roll initiative as the mirror shatters around them, sending them tumbling in different directions, as their own reflections rise out of the glass to attack. (if nobody notices, roll initiative anyways and treat it as a surprise round)

Combat

There are a few ways to run this combat. But the basics are that everyone is fighting an evil mirror image of themselves inside a shattered mirror zone, you can use your PCs own stat blocks, doppelgangers or the Shadow stat block. Another way to make the encounter more interesting is too put the enemies under the effect of the mirror image spell, i also recommend vulnerability to bludgeoning damage, (this combat is designed to be more psychologically terrifying, feel free to make it more or less deadly) It is up to you to decide what an “evil reflection” means for each of your players, I will be showing my PCs worst case scenarios of their lives (Aasimar falling, dying of alcohol poisoning, killed by past enemy, lost control of  wild magic etc) but you can do whatever! 

I’m planning on setting up a series of small rooms across my battle map, and every round switching the minis to replicate the changing shattering landscape. Once a doppelganger is defeated, the PC will appear at the top of the tower, once they are all defeated, the tower will pull its final trick, and begin to crumble, with all the PCs on its roof

  

Those Meddling Kids

An evil and eccentric  human wizard named Battamok has decided he must have Morgan island all to himself, and has been summoning elementals every night to scare away the settlers. He is living in the woods under a pile of sticks, and is a coward with a  spellcaster (or lightning mage) statblock. 

Introduction

Morgan island is a fairly underdeveloped island with a lot of woods, there are not many actual buildings, and most people live in tents, which is a problem since storm elementals have been ravaging through the settlement. The barkeep, Jack, asks the party to go stop the elemental, and see where it’s coming from. 

  
  

Fighting an Elemental

The elemental appears at dusk, or whenever Jack tells the party about it. The it uses a storm elemental stat block, if it gets to 30 hp or less, it will attempt to flee, as Battamok calls it back to his side. The party can then use this to track the elemental deeper into the woods (stealth vs nature, the elemental is very fast) and encounter Battamok in his odd little hovel. 

Battamok the Impractical

Battamok is a wizened old weirdo, whose motivation for scaring people away was peace and quiet. Stating he's been on this island for decades. He has a spellcaster statblock and will fight the party, but if dropped to 10hp or lower will surrender and start crying. Looking around the campsite or on his person, the party will find a blue gem with storm clouds rolling over it. This is how Battamok summoned his elementals, and it will lose power if taken from the island, becoming a simple gemstone worth 50 gp.

  

Oops all War crime

The war between Sea Elves and Sahuagin is well documented, and while Ruto Reef is a strictly civilian settlement, they have been subject to multiple raids by a Sahuagin force and their hobgoblin allies. If the party asks about the damage, the residents will explain the situation. The barkeep also tells them not to stay long in town to avoid conflict.

How to find love (or a raiding party of monsters)

The villagers do not know where the party is camped, or how to find them. But they know they are around the cliffs to the north. They will allow the party to go to the docks and borrow someone’s boat to go explore, a successful DC 15 survival check will lead your party to a small group of Hobgoblins sitting by a campfire on a beach

# It’s a Trap!

There are 1d6+3 Hobgoblins alone on the beach. The  beach itself has a large rocky cliff behind it which is 30 feet tall, and many rocks in the water. The surf is rough today, and the water cloudy, meaning the party cannot see the additional 1d6+4 Sahuagin hiding among the rocks, ready to spring up and attack. The water close to shore is about 3 feet deep and will function as difficult terrain if your party members enter. There is also a Sahuagin Priestess and Hobgoblin captain higher on the cliff. It is a DC 15 check to climb the cliff at full speed, and a DC 10 to climb at half, unless they have a climbing speed. As soon as the party lands on the beach the Hobgoblins attack, after half their number (or 3) hobgoblins die, the Sahuagin join the fight, once two more are killed, the priestess and captain join. 

# Loot Corpses it’s fun.

The hobgoblin captain has a small ivory goat on his person, a figurine of wondrous power. (This can be a by the book figurine but I’m changing it because my players are weird and want to start a cheese business sooo.) The hobgoblin soldiers have 1d4+1 potion of healing amongst them. The Sahuagins soldiers have nothing. The Sahuagin priestess has battle documents written in aquan, which, if  brought back to Ruto Reef, will help protect the town

Finishing the Quest 

When the party returns with proof of the hobgoblins demise, and/or the military documents, whoever they chose to bring them to will be delighted, and dive underwater to the leader of the colony, they are very grateful but have nothing left to offer.

  
  

A Haunted Lighthouse. How Original.

Nobody has seen the lighthouse keeper in weeks… The lighthouse on Bournda Bar has been overtaken by shadows and it's up to the party to see what happen. Douglass Everett the keeper, has been holed up at the very top for almost two weeks, starving, cold and dehydrated, to avoid the shadows that lurk below.

Introduction

When the party is close to leaving the island, (or any time they are alone without any other residents around) a young girl named Matilda in a frock with a hoop will approach them, telling them that Her Daddy, the lighthouse keeper, a man named Douglas Everett, hasn’t been home to visit in two weeks, and she needs the adventurers to go check on him. Once they agree, the little girl's mother, presumably the wife, introduces herself as Eveline, a young woman in a blue dress and an apron, comes over and tells the adventurers that the little girl is right, and they would appreciate it if someone  would go check . If the adventurers accept, they give directions to the lighthouse, and then start walking up towards the cliff and out of sight. If the players ask any of the other residents about the lighthouse, they claim not to know anything, or don’t talk about it at all.

The lighthouse

The lighthouse is on the opposite side of the island, isolated, it's about  a 45 minute trek. The winds whip hard and the sky is gloomy. The light shines out, breaking a line through the oncoming mist. The railing around it rusted, dented, and missing in sections. The garden is overgrown, A DC 20 perception check finds a broken hoop in the tangle, the fence is rotting, and the paint is peeling. The entire place has a sense of dis-ease, the lighthouse is completely dark, except for the light at the top. A battered outhouse leans sideways, and Behind the lighthouse, hidden away, is a small graveyard, with two graves, so worn down and overgrown they have become unreadable. These are the graves of Eveline and Matilda who died 50 years ago in an accident. An angry old tomcat hides in the garden and hisses at anyone who gets near

First floor

The door falls off its hinges if anyone touches it, opening up to a kitchen dining room area. Everything is coated in dust as nobody has been in this room in two weeks, and some half eaten food is on the table, also covered in dust and moulding. There is a very old, yellowing, grainy picture hanging about a fireplace, a handsome young man, smiling, with his arm around Eveline, who is holding a younger Matilda in her arms. They’re standing in  front of the lighthouse, which looks neat and proud. One Shadow is hiding in the dusty fireplace and will attack anyone who gets near. 

To the left of the room is stairs leading up, and to the right are 3 bedrooms.

Bedroom one: a child's bedroom, it smells of mothballs and mildew, and the paint is peeling. Nobody has been in here for 50 years. Toys stack in the corner. One shadow lurks amongst the toys, and will attack if disturbed. 

Bedroom two: what used to be a master bedroom. A queen sized bed perfectly made, and untouched for many years, this room is also untouched, and filled with more yellowed photos, Douglas and Eveline on their wedding day, matilda being brought into the lighthouse, matilda playing with a kitten. 1d4 shadows lurk in here, and will attack if  anyone touches the bed or photos. 

Bedroom three: this is the bedroom Douglas has been living in, there is less dust here, and the bed is messy and unkempt, the paint is still peeling, and the smell of  mildew is almost stronger here, as well as the stench of alcohol. There are no photos in here, but clothes scattered across the floor. 2 shadows are hiding in here, and will attack  when someone nears the bed, or reaches the center of the room. 

Stairwell

The stairs are a pitch black spiral staircase they are 10 feet wide, and have 2d4+half the party number of shadows that will attack from the top when the adventurers get close. If there are undefeated shadows from the lower levels left, they will join the fight after 1d4 rounds or when all their brethren are dead, blocking off the exit.

Top of the Lighthouse. 

At the top of the lighthouse, the party will find Douglas, emaciated, and pressed against the large light, his only protection from the shadows below. Douglas is an old man, nothing like the pictures downstairs. He has  leathery skin, wild grey hair, and an unkept beard. If asked about his wife and child, he will become confused, and explain that his wife and daughter died in an accident. Matilda was playing with her hoop on top of the lighthouse, and Eveline was watching. A strong wind blew the hoop over the edge, and when Matilda went to grab it, the railing broke and she fell, Eveline tried to catch her, but fell as well. Their graves are behind the lighthouse. That was 50 years ago. He thanks the party for their help in clearing out the shadows, and gets emotional if his wife and child are mentioned again.

Finishing the Quest

Douglas is thankful, but does not have much to offer the party (DM discretion on rewards) he promises to check in with the rest of the town more often, and to invest in candles. 

As the party leaves, they have a feeling of being watched. If they look back, they will see a young woman and a child standing at the top of the lighthouse, waving, and they can swear they hear the words “thank you.” as the light sweeps back around, the figures disappear, and the wind dies down for the first time since they arrive.

  
  

A mossy infestation

Fox spit has an unfortunate problem, green Dragon wyrmlings have taken roost deeper in the woods, and it seems like they want to stay. There is 1 wyrmling for every member of the party, +1d4, hidden deeper in the forest, building the beginnings of a lair, if your party is higher level, consider throwing a young green in there as well

Introduction

CeCe mentions a problem with creatures rifling through their trash, and other residents might notice a problem. CeCe tells the party that the Wyrmlings are coming from deeper in the woods, and offers them a free round of drinks, if they can go and  kill them all. And bring the bodies back.

Traveling

The woods are dense and mossy, though wyrmlings are not yet strong enough to manipulate their surroundings, (if a young dragon is with them, check the monster manual for info on a green dragons lair) it will take a successful DC 15 nature check to find, 

Dragon Lair

The green dragons live in a thicket, the ground is difficult terrain for medium creatures or larger, and the dragons can climb up the branches and vines.

 Finishing the quest  

After bringing the corpses back, CeCe thanks them, gives them their drinks, and also offers to let them loot the bodies for poison/spell components.

  

A modest test of strength

The shrine on eventide island has been overtaken by monsters of unknown origin. The shrine is one of the last remaining relics of a kingdom long forgotten (Tomb of Witch King/Queen come from the same kingdom). As a sacred test of strength and with for their knights and place of holy reflection. It is said a reward was given to the knights at the end of  the test.

Introduction

 A blind satyr, the guardian of the shrine who use to sit on the steps and wait for adventurers, has been driven away after dark creatures made their home in the depths of the shrine, he is blind, and was unable to tell what beasts lay below, but pleads with the party to go and rid the shrine of the evil, warning however that the shrine itself will be its own challenge…

Entering 

Entering the shrine is easy,  it is on the highest peak of the island, glowing with blue light, as the eternal flame used to power this nation burns within. It is a simple structure, with an altar in the center, the satyr explains that the adventurers need only stand on the altar together  and accept the challenge. Then the altar descends into darkness…

Room One- Fire.

This room has dried vines coating the walls, and no visible exit, with two torches burning blue flames. These flames are both Lesser Fire Elementals and will attack whoever touches the torches directly, before retreating back to flame form, if the torches are knocked over, they will attack and not stop until they are killed. If an object is held over the flames to light it, the elementals will not attack. This flame can then be used to catch the vines on fire, revealing the door to the next room.

Room Two- Earth.

This room is warm, with moss growing everywhere and a single ray of sunlight descending from a ceiling 200ft high. On the opposite side of the room is a single door with a sun motif in the middle. Once  the players enter the room, the trap will activate, and a DC 15  perception check will be required to spot what is about to happen and avoid being surprised. 3 Basilisks, jump out  and will engage with the party. Any player with a passive perception higher than 15 will notice a small mirror sitting on the  ground. This mirror can be used to reflect the light onto the door, with  a successful DC10 sleight of hand check. (no check required if out of combat). This will open the door and allow the party to pass to the next room, once they are through the door, the basilisks will not follow.

Room Three- Air

I stole this directly from Harry Potter don’t judge me and also: Fuck Jk Rowling.

This room has no floor, it has a 100ft chasm stretching across, with a door  on the other side, with no ledge. If the players are rushing through from the last room, have whoever is in front make a DC15 dex save or fall into the abyss. After about 30 feet of falling, the PC will begin to float, and has a fly speed equal to their walking speed. Room is filled with tiny Sprites, each carrying a key. Only one however is real and the rest are illusions, and they are zipping around, your party must determine the real one. If they grab the wrong one the sprite will attack. The sprites have an AC of 15, and to grab on will require an attack roll at disadvantage as all the sprites are taking the dodge action. It is a DC15 check to determine the right one, that must be rerolled at the start of every turn as the sprites move erratically. Once the right key is found, the door can be unlocked and your party can progress. 

Room Four- Water

This room is dark, except for a still pool of water in the center, that glows with light from within, four pearls sit on the floor, around the pool. at each corner is a statue of a water naiad each about 7 feet tall each have a few key differences

1-Left closest to entrance: this one is steaming ever so slightly

2-Right Closest to entrance: This one has water dripping down it from an unknown source

3- Right farthest from entrance: this one is standing in a small pool of water

4- Left Farthest from entrance: this one has small clouds that float around it  

, one arm stretched up towards the ceiling, one holding a sword pointed towards the pool. If your players look into the pool, they will see what appears to be another room underwater, there are no other visible exits. If the players disturb the water, the statues rush forward and stab them, (they use an animated armor stat block) before swiftly returning to their pedestals.

The way to solve the puzzle and safely pass through the pool is to place the pearls into the statue's hands in the order of the water cycle, in this case the order is 1-4-2-3. If they places the pearls in the wrong order, the statues will stab them and all will drop their pearls. Once all the statues have pearls in their hands, your players may go through the pool to the final room. Going through this room gives them the benefits of a long rest. 

Final Room

Originally, this room was simply meant as the reward room, but the monsters the satyr mentioned have taken up residence here (do not ask me how they got there I DON’T KNOW)  2 Scrags are camped here, and will attack as soon as the party enters. 

There is also a door at the far end, with no keyhole or handle, just four symbols. The symbols for earth water fire and air. The party must press each symbol in the order of the dungeon to unlock the final room, which is just a small alcove with a potion of climbing, and a brooch of shielding.

There is also a raised altar identical to the one at the entrance, and once the final door is opened, the altar will glow with blue light, indicating it is ready to be used, it will take them up again to the entrance of the shrine, on top of the hill. 

I still believe in Goblins

If the players snub the nekrogoblikon, they will be in for a nasty surprise. As the nekrogoblikon has more than just his magical wishing spider, and will track down and attack the party.

Introduction

The introduction to the nekrogoblikon is described in the island table on Isla Coconut. If the party is rude, or insults the goblin, they may face his wrath. Wherever the party goes to sleep that night, the Nekrogoblikon will find them. The party will be awoken by the sound of skittering, as the Nekrogoblikon brought all his spider babies with him…

Burn the Whole Thing Down.

The nekrogoblikon (goblin stat block with the leadership trait from hobgoblin stat block) has come prepared with spider swarms equaling the number in the party plus 2d4. And his “magic spider” who is now a giant spider with twice as many HP as the normal stat block. (same sized tophat) who will position itself on the ceiling to shoot webs. They will surprise the party as they rest or sleep. If the Nekrogoblikon is dropped to 0 hp, the spider swarms will scatter, as the Goblin changes form into a Grell.

  

A Boggling Problem

A fey crossing has formed in the basement of the Salted Turtle. Boggles have infested Pierre the tortles wine storage, as well as a very angry Displacer Beast. tt’s up to the party to get them out!

Introduction

Pierre tells the party they don’t have their usual drink menu because of an infestation in the storage area. He doesn’t want to tell the sailors because last time he had them help they ended up breaking all his barrels. He will offer the party a free barrel of whatever booze they want, if they go down and kill whatever creatures are down there. 

Mind Boggling fight

The basement is only about 10 feet wide and 30 feet long. There are 4d4 boggles in here, plus one for every member of the party. If any party member speaks sylvan, they will begin to here grunts, and songs as they get closer, everyone else will just hear odd skittering like rats or other pests. The basement is filled with barrels and kegs, and is dark. Once all the party is deep in the basement, the Boggles make themselves known, blocking the exit.

The Boggles are actually just following around a much more powerful creature. A single Displacer Beast is hiding out of sight, and will attack if the party finds it, or half the Boggles are killed.

Finishing

As promised, Pierre gives them a free barrel of booze, and immediately starts fey proofing his bar with iron nails, along with the salt and rat poison. 

  

 A Rather Blustery Day 

Oak Harbor used to be a bustling town, and a sister port for Rose Keep, but a dangerous air elemental has emptied the town. 

Introduction 

Beebop will give free mozzarella sticks (or any reward you choose) for the removal of this elemental. The Frat boys will also mention the air elemental problem.

# Oh Bother.

A DC 10 nature check can be used to determine the elementals most recent path, which will lead the party down to a beach, where one air elemental is ravaging a beachside cabin. To cross the beach needs a successful DC 10 dexterity check, or treat it as difficult terrain, as it is covered in driftwood and rocks. The elemental will engage as soon as it notices the  party. For every 30 points of damage  it takes, it will  summon a smaller elemental to come and help, (mod. statblock of a regular elemental but an AC of 10, and 35 HP and +4 to hit) 

Finishing

Once the air elementals are dead, the sky will clear for the first time since arriving. Signaling that the terror is over. 

  
  

You the devil in disguise 

On the west side of Angel wings Atoll, there is a quaint cabin hidden from the shore; it has gardens, a chicken coop, and smoke rising from the chimney, with the smell of baking bread wafting through the air. One or two goats roam the property, inside lives Mendax, an Angel. Sweet and kind with eyes as blue as the sea, and sky colored wings tucked against her back, she welcomes the adventurers, feeds them, and even offers to let them spend the night. What they do not know is that Mendax means liar in latin, and they are in the lair of a Succubus named Veritas, and that under the floorboards are the husks of all the adventurers who were unfortunate enough to stumble into her home. 

Introduction

Any other travelers the party meets on the atoll will give a warning of the dangers of the west side, nobody knows what’s over there, all they know is that ever since the island was settled, anyone who  goes into that forest, never walks out. 

Running Mendax/Veritas

Mendax will try to alleviate the parties suspicions, if there is a paladin, or a creature with a divine sense, she will attempt to charm them first, so as to hide her true nature. She wants the party to spend the night, and will do everything to convince them of this. Once she has them where she wants them, she will order whoever is charmed to attack their party members in their sleep, reveal her true form, and draining kiss the charmed individual. If the party attacks or discerns the truth before this, she will reveal her true form early and attack. If she can sow distrust or paranoia within the party, she will.

The Battle

As soon as Mendax becomes Veritas, the entire cabin changes from a quaint lodge to a demonic home, plants wither, wood darkens, and bars cover the windows. Veritas will use every trick in the book to win, sliding in and out of the ethereal plane, charming whoever she can, and turning the party against each other. Once defeated, her body will erupt into flames, and burn to ash, catching the house on fire. 

  

Howl you doin

Coupe Isle has a wolf problem. These wolves have been stealing food and items from the residents. A clarinet from schon, a notebook full of song ideas from Chell, Milk and Lily’s couple necklaces, Knights art that she doesn’t want anyone to see, Jonathan's weights (not that anyone is complaining) and Dicky’s glasses. They have regrettably not taken Kobis trombone yet. They don’t know who is stealing the stuff, but they suspect it could be the wolves that recently moved closer to town. But In fact, Kobi has been stolen as well, and replaced with a Bone Devil. The wolves have been driven out of their den by the Barbed Devils pet Death Dogs.

Introduction

Other people may mention the missing objects, or the wolf problem, but nobody will ask the party to do  anything specifically except Dicky,  who has lost his glasses and become essentially blind because of it. He claims to have asked the other residents to look into it multiple times, but none of them seemed to care.

A Ruff time

It won’t take long for the party to find  the wolves. A successful DC10 investigation check will show  the party that there are about 15 in total, 8 adults, 7 pups, and they are moving throughout the town, rummaging through garbage. These wolves are emaciated, skittish, and a few are injured, if they party tries to drive them away, they will head into the woods, towards the area around  their den, and if the party placate them, with a successful DC17 animal handling check, the wolves will lead them to the den themselves. It is about an hour long hike  through dense woods to the den. 

All dogs go to heaven but maybe not these ones.

The wolf den has been overtaken by two death dogs. The death dogs will defend the den until one of them dies, at which time the other will try to flee to warn it’s master of the threat. Inside the den, all the missing items are stashed, along with a lantern of revealing, and an alchemist's jug, as well as a tied up, gagged, and very dirty Kobi. But if the real kobi is here… who was the person your party met at the bar…?

Band kids are the Devil.

If the death dog gets away, the devil will be ready and waiting for the party, he has closed down the shop, taken Schon hostage, and will be waiting for the party at a table in a Kobi form with his death dog.

If the party catches the devil by surprise, the bar will be packed, but the patrons will flee at the first sign of battle. Real Kobi is too weak to fight. Fake Kobi uses a Bone Devil Statblock with one difference

He has a recharge ability, as an action he may play the trombone, and any  creature that hears this must make a DC 14 con saving throw or take 2d6 psychic damage, or half as much on a success. This ability recharges on a 5 or 6 on a D6.

Finishing

If they return ricky's glasses, he will offer them a free map, knight will offer each of them a free item from her store, Schon and Kobi will give them free drinks for the rest of the night! They don’t know who owned the alchemists jug or the Lantern, and will let the party keep that.
