## Backstory 

The only son of a nouveau riche family, the birth of Espero Dominguez's conception was the greatest gift to the aging Luciana and Manuel Dominguez. His new journey amongst the living was all but determined; a life of wealth, power and influence. Yet despite the silver spoon in his mouth, this road was not to be his final path. In less than a year from his birth, the Dominguez family among many others would fall to ruin, the name dragged through the mud with allegations of corruption. Manuel's business was siezed as a part of fruitless fraud investigations but the Dominguez name would never be cleared. Nor would the assets be returned. Reduced to lowly street urchins, Luciana and Manuel did not survive long.

In what was hoped to be a turn of fate, Espero was taken into an orphanage that was founded by kind patron families across the city, including the Dominguezes. But with most of the founding families having crumbled away, little oversight remained over the orphanage. Soon, even this last shelter for Espero became corrupted. As young Espero grew, the state of the orphanage decayed. Quality food was substituted for gruel and the formerly caring hand of the staff was replaced with viciousness and cruelty. The decade of malnourishment and abuse at the hands of his guardians tore away at his flesh and bones but tempered his mind and resolve.

As an act of pity towards his family, Espero was granted entrance into one of the few schools in the region. In a world of nobility, Espero was outcast. The teachers avoided him, the students tormented him. Only Pablo Esquela, the school's teacher for phyiscal education and shooting instructor cared for Espero. The only lessons Espero ever took from that school were reading and how to handle a gun - the school had a proud history of pistol marksmanship.

In the year of his graduation, the orphanage finally collapsed, the last dollar siphoned from the ledger. The last of his family's legacy had been torn from this world. Like his parents before him, Espero fell into the life of a street urchin. One day on the streets, he was told by a graying man that his father's family was destroyed so that the old money in the city could sieze more power, and that man was one of the men bribed to "investigate" his family. After this fateful encounter, Espero then fell into a life of crime, only to once again encounter a different graying man who had sought him out. A fatally ill pirate, he was saved by the same orphanage Espero attended when it was in its prime. To repay the debt to the families that took him in, the pirate had found the orphans of the families that were wiped out and gave them his ship, telling them that they have no life here and even if they build something here, the old money families would simply take them down again. They would have freedom on the ocean. Not willing to leave the land of his family behind, Espero vowed to return with the greatest pirate fleet there ever was and to make the old money families pay.

Quick question answers:

1. Parents are dead. Only people Espero has a bond with are the school teacher Pablo Esquella, and the orphans from the other new money families who have since become part of his crew - Alejandra Nuno (F) Juan Marco (M) Gonzalo Calles (M) and Pedro Salome (M).

2. Espero never knew his familial home. He only knew the orphanage and school which were the closest places to home he ever had.

3. Excellent marksman skill from pistols but only trained with flintlock pistol - trained by Pablo Esquella.

4. Espero had fallen into a life of crime when approached by a fatally ill pirate who had in his youth been taken in by the same orphanage that was set up by Espero's father and other prominent new money families in the city. He chose a life of adventuring (piracy) in order to gain power to exact his revenge

5. Espero has not known a good life. He will rest anywhere and does not particularly care about his appearance unless it will serve him to appear a certain way. Espero does not care about money, only the power that money can buy him. He will happily sleep on the floor if the money he saves buys him another bullet. Espero is untrusting by nature but enjoys the company of those he trusts.

6. Espero (currently) believes in an eye for an eye. He believes in sharing equally what is earnt. He also believes in letting those who give up walk away but struggles to uphold this belief against those who have wronged him.

7. Espero hates stuck up people who come from old money. He hates corruption and would sooner kill a corrupt businessman or politician than a thief on the street.

8. Espero is not religious and is particularly faithless towards gods of justice as he has never experienced any so called godly justice. Justice for Espero is at the end of a barrel and not in the hands of the divine.

9. No children, no women, no torture, no killings of those who surrender. Espero will also accept honourable challenges against other captains in lieu of each ship blowing the other to parts.

10. Espero likes to carve tiny figures from flotsam. Espero's enjoyment of woodworking extends to engraving. He also likes to practise his aim and keep his crew well trained by holding shooting competitions aboard the ship.

11. Espero tries to stay away from alcohol but as soon as he starts drinking he loses his self control and cant stop himself.

12. Espero hates music - it was something reserved only for the upper class that tore his life into shreds. He actively breaks instruments.

13. Espero loves his crew and his former teacher. As a criminal, Espero made a small name for himself and has various connections to the underworld in his home port. With this, he can often get information about ship routes.

14. Espero has sworn to destroy all the old money families from his home. He is especially destructive towards any of the assets held by these old money families, particularly ships.

15. Espero hates rats and lashes. His orphanage in its later years were filled with rats that frequently woke him up. As discipline, he was whipped in his orphanage and bears scars on his back. Whenever he sees lashes he throws them overboard and the sight of someone approaching him with lashes instils a chilling fear in his body. Espero does not allow lashes on his ships under any circumstances.

16. Espero is a pirate, soon to be the greatest pirate captain there ever was. He will be the destroyer of the old money. He will be a just captain to those he commands and he will be a unrelenting enemy for those who cross him. But deep down, Espero knows that one day he wants to put this life behind and this anger towards the old money behind him. He sometimes doubts whether he has the strength to see his mission through and is scared of killing his companions in his personal vendetta.

17. Espero deep down wants a just governance of his home and to ensure nobody suffers his fate but he sees this as the total destruction of the old money families in the city. Perhaps room for this to change? meets girl from old money or something?

18. Espero is very conscious of his scars. He is always fully clothed and has never shown his body to anyone outside of the guardians at the orphanage. Espero is also ashamed of his criminal past - he shot an innocent man and sends part of his loot to their family.

19. Zoro with a pirate hat - the bandana eye mask thing is a very crucial component. Black clothes everywhere regardless of whether it is fancy dress or not. Full sleeves and full pants that are never rolled up no matter the condition. basically the only parts of his body he shows are his hands and head.

20. Espero fights with a pistol and a rapier though he is more proficient with his pistol. When Espero is disarmed he feels out of place. When Espero has a pistol he becomes more confident.

21. Espero does not trust authority. A title or position does not automatically earn his trust as even they are just men who can be corrupted. Espero only trusts those who have been with him and have earnt that trust. Espero currently sees the world as black and white in the sense that whatever he does he must do it for his revenge and there is no right or wrong per se so long as he does not exceed his morals as referenced above. Commoners and low level criminals are better than aristocrats and the wealthy.

22. Met my initial companions when first getting the ship - they were others who have been in that orphanage from the families that funded it. Since then, the ship has changed to accommodate new crew but the original ship is moored in a secret location that Espero and the original (npc) crew know. The rest can be picked up from other crews after combats or recruited from bars unless inconsistent with their backstories. I am the captain, I care for my crew and try to serve their interests so long as it is not detrimental to the collective interest.

23. I am extremely loyal to my crew. Having had nobody growing up, the crew is the closest thing I have had to a family of my own and I would die for them, which is why I will fight 1 on 1 with another captain to solve a fight instead of fighting with our crews and ships.

24. Espero's favourite colour is blue. The only thing he owns that isn't black is a pistol with blue accents and a rapier with blue accents. He hopes to one day be confident enough in his appearance to wear blue.

25 bonus: some secret even Espero doesnt know - original ship has some secret for the discretion of the dm (note we are not on original ship, original ship was for npc crew from the other orphanage founding families).

## Backstory 

Piracy: for when you don’t want to be a bootlicker, but still want to chase the 3Gs—gold, glory, gospel.

Hailing from the seaside province of Canton in the Middle Kingdom, Yang Nova had quite the mundane childhood, despite his… ancestry. He was born, got dumped onto his father by his mother, grew up, went to school, got kicked out of school, and thus spent most of his childhood helping his father.

  

His family isn’t big, but it isn’t small either, consisting of five members:

- Simon Yang Zhu Ho (阳朱河), his father,
    
- Mituna Yang Zhang Yi (阳张翼), his eldest brother,
    
- Sollux Yang Yi Ho (阳二河), his elder brother,
    
- Yang Xing (阳星), his twin sister,
    
- And of course, him—阳诺洼. But he doubts people can pronounce that properly, so just call him Nova.
    

  

(There’s also his mother, of course, but she isn’t too important; she was practically never home, anyways.)

  

Nova’s always been a problem child: from a young age, he was getting into fights left and right. Predictably, he wasn’t very well-liked for this–not that he cared–which may or may not have led to him nearly getting drowned as a “prank”.

  

He left home as soon as he was old enough, following his mother onto her ship to learn what life’s like at sea. When he decided he had a good grasp on it, he left, looking for a crew that’s unaffiliated with her instead.

  

And this is how he joined—in a bar, he escalated an already tense situation between the crew and some people, resulting in everyone being thrown out for fighting. Though a bit of a knucklehead, his martial prowess is no joke–he came out of it unscathed, relative to those who met his fists–and was willing to accept a lower pay/loot portion and higher workload in order to join.

## Notes

Goals:

- Short Term: ”What use is life if you don’t have fun?” Fuck bitches, get money. EZ.
    
- Medium Term: “Beat 妈? Who knows, maybe she’ll finally retire and give me her legion.” Beat the Marquise in a fight. At least hand-to-hand combat.
    
- Long Term: “As 大哥 likes to say: live fast, die young.” Leave behind a blazing legacy for generations of wannabe pirates to look up to.
    

  

Secret

- Known Secret:
    

- He’s the bastard son of the captain of the Novafire’s Cerulean Scorpion fleet, Marquise Spinnerette Mindfang.
    

- Suggestions for Unknown Secret:
    

- His father’s martial prowess is never explained. There are speculations, but no confirmation.
    
- His parents’ history together is unknown.
    
- Nothing about his elder brothers’ mother is known: not their past, not their identity, and not what has become of them.
    

  

3 Near and Dear NPCs 

- NPC 1: “You want me to choose which person I like most? Man, they’ll have my head on a pyre before I can even say a word….” I’m gonna bundle his entire family into one NPC because yes.
    
- NPC 2: “The ring? Yeah, I’m taken. …Wipe that look off your face.” His wife.
    
- NPC 3: “I get that the bandana’s tacky and draws too much attention, but it’s important, alright?” One of the medical staff on his mother’s ship, a younger lady named Kasei Yuki. They grew close since he kept getting goddamn injured, and she corresponds with him from time to time.
    

  

3 Important Memories

- Memory 1: “Who knew the old man had moves like that…” His dad got so tired of him getting into fights (and losing), that he decided to teach him how to win. Training started with an ass-kicking of such heavenly proportions it’ll be the last thing he remembers on his deathbed.
    
- Memory 2: “I know, I know. ‘A pirate who’s afraid of water? No fucking way.’ Funny, right? Maybe I should drown you a little, see how you like that.” He nearly drowned as a toddler after a bunch of asshole older kids played a ‘prank’ on him. This is how he met his spouse—they happened to be swimming by, and saved him.
    
- Memory 3: 
    

  

# Extra Details:

- He’s kinda helpless without his glasses—his eyesight is shit, especially in his left eye: without his glasses, he’s effectively as good as blind in that eye.

## Backstory 

1. Caladrius Simurg is the only child of the Simurg family. The Simurg comes from the people of Sarkany, a deer-dragon humanoid hybrid. They live long lives, maturing slowly and having small numbers of progenies. When the Sarkany dies, they turn into trees and continue growing. The descendants would then care for this tree, allowing it to grow further. For the Sarkany, true death comes if they die as a tree. As such, Caladrius surrounds himself with plant caring knowledge and cares for nature.
    
2. Home is the Island of Ağaç, (Agk) used to be wild and free, with a stable and diverse ecosystem. In the middle of the island is the Grove, where the tree Sarkany are at. It’s Caladrius’ favourite place in the island, where he’d commune with his elders, whether to be asking for guidance or just…chilling.
    
3. His plant caring knowledge comes from a Jati, a living plant that lives symbiotically with the Sarkany in the island of Ağaç.
    
4. He is an adventurer at the moment as he escaped the island that’s currently under the Navy’s control. He’s looking for a way to regain control of his island and kick the Navy out. Should the Navy not come, he’d be a herbalist/botanist and leader of his people.
    
5. A nice life is one where one can frolic in the woods, commune with their deceased, and be at peace watching the sky, surrounded by family.
    
6. Caladrius believes in maintaining balance in the natural world. He believes in plant rights, especially those that can’t communicate with the majority.
    
7. People who abuse nature would drive him nuts. Though he would prefer to settle things diplomatically, *that* would get under his skin.
    
8. The pair deities Mehtap and Güneş (yunes) is believed to be their creator, though, Mehtap in particular was said to have created the Sarkany as a symbol of his love for his wife. It is said that when the world was created, Güneş first scattered plant life on it. But she soon found out that her trees can’t grow as big as she wanted. Seeing his wife unhappy, Mehtap decided to give part of him to the trees so they could grow big. He wanted them to be able to fend for themselves and that is why they were born as deer-dragon humanoids in the first part of their lives.  
    So, in their humanoid part of their lives, they would pray to Mehtap and in their tree part of their lives, they would pray to Güneş.
    

Caladrius doesn’t mind the belief of other deities. 

9. The harming of plant life for no reason or with disrespect.
    
10. Caladrius likes to read out books to plants, or to anyone that would listen.
    
11. He can’t help but *stare* at things that interest him.
    
12. He hates loud music and rowdy dancing. So annoying. So high pitched. So headache inducing.
    
13. The ones he cares the most are his people, his great-grandpa and his Jati mentor Ahihia. Being a member of the island that cares for plants, he is highly regarded. Ahihia accepted him as his apprentice for his hard work,determination and extreme care for plant life.
    
14. Obviously, the Navy. They came to the island, demanded the wood of the tree Sarkany for their ships, burned the island when they were refused, captured the people, treating them like lifestocks and culled them systematically to provide a new source of wood. Adding insult to the injury, they pretended that if Caladrius took an eye out, the sarkany would be spared. NOPE.
    
15. FIRE. SPECIFICALLY HUGE ASS FIRE.
    
16. A conservationist and a leader trying to get his people their rights returned.
    
17. Caladrius would very much like to see the Navy fall and restore his island.
    
18. He…actually enjoys meat and violence.
    
19. On his person are his sling bag, filled with implements to record plants he encounters, a silver rapier, and a big book of folklore. He had long white hair, covering his right eye. He has antlers, one broken. He wears a wide brim rattan hat and wears a half, wooden plated armour that covers his chest. You can see his tail and long ears, with his clawed, slender fingers and claws feet.
    
20. Caladrius uses his rapier for close combat, but prefers to stay at the back and cast magic most times due to his blindness in one eye. If possible, he would rather not kill or start a fight in the first place. He’s focused on being quick and nimble. If he’s stopped in his tracks though…
    
21. The world needs balance - in the form of natural balance. Not the 50-50 thing. Though nature would rebalance itself no problem, going through it would be *hell* for beings with consciousness. So, he would like it if people can understand that imbalance should *not* be let go out of hand.
    
22. He met the team when he escaped from the island and floated on a raft. The ship saw him and let him onboard. He’s the ship’s provision manager.
    
23. Captain’s motivation is to kill the Navy. Heck yeah.
    
24. Favourite colour is Raw Umber - it’s under orange-brown. A natural pigment!
