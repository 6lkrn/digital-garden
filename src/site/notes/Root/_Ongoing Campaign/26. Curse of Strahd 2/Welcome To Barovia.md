Welcome to the valley of Barovia. You will be playing as members of The Resistance. 

Your Goal? To overthrow [[Root/Worlds/Barovia/NPCs/Strahd von Zarovich\|Strahd]], a vampire lord that has enslaved the entire valley for his own mysterious goals. He is an all powerful villain that no one has been able to fight or defeat in living memory. Many foolish and brave people have tried, and their dead bodies now march under [[Root/Worlds/Barovia/NPCs/Strahd von Zarovich\|Strahd]]’s banner. He uses his armies of Vampire spawn and undead to control and oppress the people of Barovia. 

But you, yes you! Have had enough! And for some unfathomable reason you have decided to take up arms to finally rid your homelands of this evil dictator. As it stands, the resistance is in no shape to face [[Root/Worlds/Barovia/NPCs/Strahd von Zarovich\|Strahd]] and his minions. Your goal throughout the campaign is to gain enough allies, weapons, knowledge and power to finally defeat him. You may choose exactly how your characters go about this. 

Curse of Strahd is an exciting, tense, fast-paced adventure. It is a vivid exploration of classic gothic horror tropes and monsters, from werewolves to vampires, ghosts, and more. It is a true sandbox, providing players with the freedom to make their own choices and build the kind of adventure they enjoy. It is a character-driven campaign, giving your player character an incredible chance to shine and make their mark on the story your group tells.

However, Curse of [[Root/Worlds/Barovia/NPCs/Strahd von Zarovich\|Strahd]] is also a brutal, stressful, and deadly experience. Your character will be trapped in a bleak, gothic land quite different from the standard fantasy worlds full of heroes and dramatic victories that we know. The adventure contains several encounters and areas that will likely be far beyond your capabilities when you first encounter them. It does not provide routine or readily-available loot or magical items.

The people in Barovia are depressed, they have no hope and no happiness. They have become a vicious and brutal lot that will do whatever it takes to survive in this dark and twisted land. They bend to Strahds will out of fear and dare not speak out or act against [[Root/Worlds/Barovia/NPCs/Strahd von Zarovich\|Strahd]] or his people in any way, shape or form. It will be up to you to encourage these beaten down people to rise up against tyranny. But it will not be a fun or rewarding task, expect betrayal at every turn. Expect everyone to have hidden motives or to be engagin in secret dealings. The world is even more messed up than it would appear on the surface. 

Curse of Strahd can suck. Really suck. Just engaging in combat or exploring the world can be incredibly deadly. There will be gruesome depictions of horror or psychologically disturbing relationships. And there is a very real chance of everyone ending up dead without having achieved their goals.

- Facing an active, powerful, and personally antagonizing villain
    

Warnings

- Intrepid adventurers and sadistic murderhobos don’t last long in Barovia. Don’t tread from the beaten path unless you have good reason to, and don’t alienate or antagonize NPCs if you can avoid it. Make more friends than enemies. 
    
- Expect failure, lots of it. Externalize failure, and use setbacks or defeat as an opportunity to explore your character’s perspective and personal growth.
    
- Play smart. Many of the enemies in this adventure cannot be overcome easily in direct combat. Use guile, preparation, subterfuge, diplomacy, and research to achieve your goals.
    
- Try to remove yourself from the “XP and loot” model of progression in traditional campaigns and video games, and instead try to enjoy the narrative progression of winning allies, fulfilling objectives, and advancing the story of the campaign and player characters.
    
- Don't try to play an apathetic or evil player character unless you are 100% sure that you can pull it off while being a supportive team player and engaging the story like a normal You don't need to play a knight in shining armor, but you definitely shouldn't play a villain.
    
- Curse of Strahd, as-written, is full of disturbing and graphic content.
