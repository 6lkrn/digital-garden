Brides of Strahd 

Strahd’s eldest three vampiric consorts—Ludmilla, Anastrasya, and Volenta—serve their master loyally, but compete bitterly for his favor. As the eldest and most adept at the arcane arts, Ludmilla is Strahd’s favored research partner, developing new spells for his use while investigating the secrets of the Mists. Meanwhile, Anastrasya is a master of the arts of espionage and diplomacy, managing Strahd’s political relationships while retaining key spies in each of Barovia’s settlements. Finally, Volenta is a skilled artificer and torturer, innovating new traps to guard Ravenloft’s halls while wringing information from those who fall into them. 

Over the past hundred years, with Strahd asleep in Castle Ravenloft, each of his brides dispersed through the valley to pursue their own agendas. Now, with Strahd awoken, and his moment of reckoning at hand, each bride is desperate to prove their loyalty and worth to Strahd once more—and to win their place at his side when his grand plan comes to fruition. 



The Ladies of the Fanes 

With their holy places desecrated and their worshippers weakened and divided, two of the three Ladies of the Fanes— the Weaver and the Huntress—have been reduced to little more than spirit, unable to take action or exercise the power they once wielded. Only the Seeker, who forged a pact with Katarina, the bastard sister of Strahd von Zarovich, to free the valley from Strahd’s evil, survives. Through their pact, the Seeker subsumed Katarina’s soul to manifest an avatar of her divine power: the Vistana seer [[Root/Worlds/Barovia/NPCs/Madam Eva\|Madam Eva]]. 

Religions 

The Church of the [[Root/Worlds/Barovia/NPCs/Morninglord\|Morninglord]] 

The dominant faith in Barovia worships the deity known as the [[Root/Worlds/Barovia/NPCs/Morninglord\|Morninglord]], a god of dawn and renewal. In centuries past, with the sun always hidden behind overcast skies, the people’s faith had slowly slipped into empty ritual. With Strahd newly awoken, however, a wave of despair has swept across the valley—and, with it, a streak of religious revivalism. Vallaki in particular has seen a dramatic expansion in worshippers seeking hope, comfort, and a sense of security from the faith of their forefathers. Father Lucian Petrovich, the priest of St. Andral’s Church in Vallaki, does what he can to preach the Morningword’s grace, as described in N1. St. Andral’s Church (p. 97), but even he has his quiet doubts about how far that protection can go. 

The Names of the Gods 

# The Faith of the Ladies Three 

In Soldav, the hidden bastion of the Mountain Folk, the people still keep to the old faith of the Ladies of the Fanes: the Weaver, the Seeker, and the Huntress. They do their best to honor their goddesses with offerings of food, flowers, and song, but mourn the loss of knowledge and tradition that came when the druids betrayed their faith for Strahd’s protection. They no longer remember the sacred rites that once bound their ancestors to the Ladies’ fellowship, nor do they remember the secrets of the Ladies’ blessings. 

The Mountain Folk still remember, though, that the Weaver’s holy place was the Swamp Fane, near the ruined town on the shores of the Luna River; the Huntress's, the Forest Fane, atop Yester Hill; and the Seeker’s, the Mountain Fane, in a western clearing in the valley's woodland basin. 

They remember that the Seeker was a goddess of foresight, prophecy, and storms, her sigil a raven’s eye, ever searching. They remember that the Weaver was a goddess of resilience, craftsmanship, and care, her sigil a spider’s delicate web. They remember, too, that the Huntress was a goddess of beasts, wild places, and war, her sigil a sharpened wolf’s tooth. 

Together, this trinity oversaw each life that was born in the valley: the Seeker, forging the threads of fate that would bind them together; the Weaver, spinning those threads into a lush and vibrant tapestry; and the Huntress, cutting each thread at its appointed time, and ushering its soul into death. 

# Design Notes: Lore of Barovia 


Factions. More information about the Dark Powers' relationship with Strahd von Zarovich and Ireena Kolyana is discussed in Chapter 3: Running the Game. The deceased wereraven, Elric, has been added to the Keepers of the Feather to explain why [[Root/Worlds/Barovia/NPCs/Baba Lysaga\|Baba Lysaga]] and the druids of Yester Hill have suddenly discovered the society's existence. 

Meanwhile, the Barovian refugees have been added outside of Vallaki's walls to give Ireena a non-selfish reason to travel to Vallaki (i.e., to aid the refugees in relocating from Barovia); to explain why the village of Barovia is a hollow, empty town; and to provide [[Root/Worlds/Barovia/NPCs/Fiona Wachter\|Fiona Wachter]] with victims to offer Strahd on the night of the Vallakian "Blood Tax," which provides the players a critical opportunity to infiltrate Castle Ravenloft while Strahd is not present. 

The "good" Mountain Folk of Soldav have been added to provide the players with a meaningful opportunity to learn the history of the mad druids of Yester Hill and to hook the players into the Ladies of the Fanes questline—a narrative arc that now plays a key role in Strahd's final plan. 

Finally, the recent history of the werewolf pack has been updated to tie more strongly into the narrative of Strahd's recent reawakening, while the amber vestiges have been given "amber shards" to introduce players to their corruption on a much earlier timescale than the original module. Religions. The cult of Ezra has been added to the campaign to provide additional depth to [[Root/Worlds/Barovia/NPCs/Fiona Wachter\|Fiona Wachter]]’s characterization and to foreshadow the true nature of the Dark Powers before Ireena meets and defies them at the climax of her character arc. 

However, these defenses could not stop the wizards themselves from falling to the vestiges’ corruption. Within three generations, nearly all of the wizards were dead as described in Chapter 13: The Amber Temple (p. 181). The lone survivor—an archmage named [[Root/Worlds/Barovia/NPCs/Neferon\|Neferon]]—was transfigured to an immortal, monstrous form and settled in to guard his “hoard.” 

# Rise of Castle Ravenloft. 

This section elects to have Strahd initially refuse the dark gift of the Vampyr in order to both establish his independence from [[Root/Worlds/Barovia/NPCs/Patrina Velikovna\|Patrina]] and to set up his pact with the Dark Powers later on. The Holy Symbol of Ravenkind has been initially renamed to the Sigil of the Sun in order to provide an opportunity for the relic to be given its "Ravenkind" association later on. [[Root/Worlds/Barovia/NPCs/Patrina Velikovna\|Patrina]]'s characterization has also been somewhat further developed. This period of history is otherwise unchanged from the original module. 

Strahd Becomes the Land. This section aims to resolve the apparent contradiction between the one-year time limit that revenants have to fulfill their revenge and the fact that multiple years passed between Strahd's conquest and death. 

The druidic elders have also been added in order to justify the division between the "Forest Folk" of Yester Hill and the "Mountain Folk" of Soldav, given that the latter are an essential part of conveying the Fanes questline. 

[[Root/Worlds/Barovia/NPCs/Sergei von Zarovich\|Sergei]] and Tatyana. This section has incorporated classic Ravenloft lore regarding [[Root/Worlds/Barovia/NPCs/Sergei von Zarovich\|Sergei]]'s negligence of his priestly duties. This period of history is otherwise unchanged from the original module. 

Not long thereafter, Kasimir Velikov, investigating the secrets of the Amber Temple at [[Root/Worlds/Barovia/NPCs/Patrina Velikovna\|Patrina]]'s direction, visited the now empty manor of Argynvostholt and spoke with [[Root/Worlds/Barovia/NPCs/Godfrey Gwilym\|Sir Godfrey]]. Though Godfrey warned him to avoid the darkness that lay within the temple, Kasimir did not leave empty-handed, finding amidst the rubble an ancient map that bore the temple's location. 

As Kasimir prepared to climb the slopes of Mount Ghakis, Victor Vallakovich and Stella Wachter—the children of Baron Vallakovich and Lady [[Root/Worlds/Barovia/NPCs/Fiona Wachter\|Fiona Wachter]]—activated a prototype teleportation circle, dreaming of escaping Strahd's tyranny. The circle malfunctioned, however, and the psychic backlash tore Stella's soul from her body. Enraged by Stella's fate, Lady Wachter began recruiting a cult to depose the Vallakovich clan. 

In Krezk, the Abbot completed a prototype of his own: a monstrous flesh golem, which he set to patrolling S15. Madhouse (p. 151). He swiftly began work on his next project: a masterpiece to serve as Strahd's final bride. 

As the Abbot's grave-robbing intensified, Kasimir attempted to reach the Amber Temple, but was turned back by the vrocks of Tsolenka Pass at T2. Demon Statues (p. 157). Wounded and despondent, Kasimir returned to the dusk elves’ settlement to ponder his next move. 

The Wrath of Strahd 

Ninety days after [[Root/Worlds/Barovia/NPCs/Rahadin\|Rahadin]]'s proclamation, Strahd's undead army was finally complete. He unleashed the zombie horde against the village of Barovia—and, to punish Doru, sent him to the Barovian church to torment his father, Father Donavich. 

The zombies’ siege of the town lasted a full week, with the undead crashing against crude village fortifications night after night. Though the village was ultimately secured, dozens of lives were lost—including, on the final night, the life of Burgomaster Indirovich himself. With that, Strahd finally withdrew his forces, allowing the Barovians to heal their wounded, gather their dead, and attempt to rebuild. 

The burgomaster’s children, Ismark and Ireena, took charge of the rebuilding effort. Even so, many Barovians, fearful of Strahd’s emergence and the threat of Castle Ravenloft, left their ruined homes and broken families and fled for Vallaki to the west, hoping that its high walls could bring security. 

Many of those who remained in the village of Barovia turned on Ismark, blaming him for dissuading them from fleeing for safety weeks before. Ismark—named for his ancestor “[[Root/Worlds/Barovia/NPCs/Ismark the Great\|Ismark the Great]]”—was now mocked as “Ismark the Lesser.” 

Two nights after the siege ended, visiting the village in disguise to assure himself of its submission, Strahd caught a glimpse of Ireena in the streets—and recognized her as the spitting image of Tatyana Federovna. 

The following night, believing Ireena to be Tatyana’s latest reincarnation, Strahd visited the burgomaster’s manor and charmed his way inside before biting her. Two nights later, he visited again, overcoming Ismark and Ireena’s best efforts to resist him and biting Ireena a second time. Desperate and defiant, the two siblings placed heavy fortifications around the manor—all while doing their best to keep Strahd’s visitations hidden from the other villagers. 

Arrival of the Mists. This section aims to reconcile the module's assertion that Strahd made two pacts—one with a vestige, and one with the Dark Powers—as well as to set up Tatyana's relationship with the Dark Powers in order to give Ireena's character arc a suitable climax when she confronts her past lives' memories at Marina's Monument in Berez. This period of history is otherwise unchanged from the original module. 

Aftermath of the Wedding. This section expressly links Katarina and the Seeker, replacing Katarina's pact with the evil [[Root/Worlds/Barovia/NPCs/Mother Night 1\|Mother Night 1]] and justifying the Seeker's continued involvement in mortal affairs (when compared with the inactive Weaver and Huntress). The Heart of Sorrow has also been linked to the slaughtered castle guards to provide it with an appropriate origin story. This period of history is otherwise unchanged from—or, at least, not inconsistent with —the original module. Ghosts of the Past. This period of history is unchanged from the original module. 

Strahd's First Followers. The Dursts' history has been changed to enhance Death House's status as a "miniaturization" of Barovia, paralleling Elisabeth Durst's villainy to Strahd's. The shambling mound of the original module has been exchanged for a flesh mound bound to Walter's spirit, which both creates a more evocative final boss for the Death House dungeon and mirrors the Heart of Sorrow as a symbol of the local "Darklord's" fall from grace. Finally, Elisabeth Durst has been given an amber shard—a new kind of magical item that allows the players to connect with the vestiges of the Amber Temple before ascending Tsolenka Pass—in order to explain the source of her cult's power and to foreshadow the shards' appearance later on in the revised campaign. 

Passage Into History. This section aims to explain why Strahd—a near-five hundred-year-old vampire—has not progressed beyond the expertise of a 9th-level wizard, and to incorporate old Ravenloft lore from prior editions of D&D to add further depth to [[Root/Worlds/Barovia/NPCs/Leo Dilisnya\|Leo Dilisnya]]'s destruction and Strahd's relationship with the Wachter family. This period of history is otherwise unchanged from the original module. 

The Decades Pass. This section moves Berez's destruction further into Barovia's past, creating opportunities for Tatyana's soul to experience additional reincarnations between Marina and Ireena. This section also aims to explain the Martikovs' inheritance of the Wizard of Wines, explain the winery's close relationship with Krezk, identify the source of [[Root/Worlds/Barovia/NPCs/Baba Lysaga\|Baba Lysaga]]'s flying giant skull, and provide additional background for Strahd's vampiric brides, who have been given expanded roles in this guide in order to provide the players with level-appropriate antagonists before the final battle. The Grand Conjunction has been added to provide Strahd with a more active agenda in the time leading up to the final battle. Finally, Strahd's hibernation has been added to turn modern-day Barovia into a more active and dynamic environment and to explain the timing of Strahd's more antagonistic schemes (e.g., the destruction of the Wizard of Wines or the attack on St. Andral's church). 

Echoes of Evil. This section aims to flesh out the history of the Holy Symbol of Ravenkind, explain why Ismark Koylanovich is called Ismark "the Lesser," develop the beginnings of the Keepers of the Feather, and—by requiring Strahd to reestablish his connection to the Forest Fane upon reawakening—prevent Strahd from obtaining the necessary energy for his Grand Conjunction plan during his hibernation, thereby providing the players with a meaningful opportunity to halt his plan by reconsecrating the Fane themselves. The cult of Chernovog is incorporated from Expedition to Castle Ravenloft to justify the disappearance of the Holy Symbol of Ravenkind. 

A New Generation. This section aims to reconcile the evident contradictions between Van Richten's account of past events (in which he claims that he killed Ezmerelda's parents) and Ezmerelda's account of the same (in which she claims that Van Richten showed them mercy). Arturi Radanavich, a character of the 2nd Edition book Van Richten's Guide to the Vistani, has been added to provide additional depth to Van Richten's character and introduce Van Richten's biography to the players at Tser Pool, thereby limiting the players' suspicion when they encounter him in Vallaki. This section also aims to explain the disappearance of the winery's third enchanted gem, the source of Izek's demonic arm, the source (and speed) of Victor Vallakovich's arcane learning, and the source of [[Root/Worlds/Barovia/NPCs/Fiona Wachter\|Fiona Wachter]]'s spellcasting abilities. This period of history is otherwise unchanged from the original module. Strahd's Return. This section further develops Van 

Richten's relationship with Arturi and reworks Van Richten's original plan to slay Strahd by removing the nonsensical (and ethically problematic) "saber-toothed tiger" plot. This section also sets the wheels in motion for the adventure to come, tying together Strahd's knowledge of Van Richten's presence, Doru's transformation into a vampire, the Barovian rebellion against Castle Ravenloft, Ismark's condemnation by the villagers of Barovia, and Escher's acceptance into Strahd's collection of consorts. 

The Darkened Valley. This section provides a reasonable time period for Strahd's awakening to reverberate throughout Barovia, thereby setting up many of the challenges and conflicts, such as Kasimir's search for the Amber Temple and Stella Wachter's "illness," that the players will later face. 

The Wrath of Strahd. This section provides context for the players' arrival in the village of Barovia, setting up Ireena's journey alongside them. 

As the Monster, Strahd should disgust the players with his complete indifference to life and death, inspire pity for his inability to feel happiness or love, and frustrate the players with his refusal to ever lose his cool. 

In this role, Strahd most often feels indifferent, curious, satisfied, and determined. Consider channeling Stan Edgar (The Boys), Gus Fring (Breaking Bad), and Thanos (Avengers: Endgame). 

The Monster crushes any resistance ruthlessly and efficiently. Though he can't be provoked, he's too proud to ever flee from a fight. 

Strahd’s Relationships 

Strahd has a complex web of relationships with the denizens of Barovia, many of which are described below. 

Death House. Strahd views the cult of Death House with respectful disdain; he finds their methods and obsessions distasteful, but appreciates their efforts to bring worthy consorts and adversaries from the lands beyond the Mists. 

Village of Barovia. Strahd believes, without romance or obsession, that Ireena Kolyana’s body is the host for Tatyana’s soul, and that Tatyana’s soul belongs to him. Through his spies, he is aware of [[Root/Worlds/Barovia/NPCs/Ismark Kolyanovich\|Ismark Kolyanovich]]’s position and relationship to Ireena, but finds him to be a lackluster leader and a half-rate swordsman. He views [[Root/Worlds/Barovia/NPCs/Donavich\|Donavich]] and Doru with scorn, disdaining the convictions, pride, and faith that Doru had in life. 

Tser Pool Encampment. Strahd finds [[Root/Worlds/Barovia/NPCs/Madam Eva\|Madam Eva]] a fascinating enigma, but has come to an unspoken understanding with her: she shall read his fortune whenever he requests it, and, in exchange, he will not delve too deeply into her history or affairs. 

Old Bonegrinder. Strahd is aware of the night hag coven’s presence, but has little interest in their affairs. 

Town of Vallaki. Strahd has no interest in Baron Vargas Vallakovich, but, through his spies, believes him to be a bumbling fool. He finds Lady [[Root/Worlds/Barovia/NPCs/Fiona Wachter\|Fiona Wachter]] to be a useful agent and favors her for her family’s history of loyalty, but cares little for her obsession with Vallakian politics. He is aware of the existence of the Keepers of the Feather (though not that the Blue Water Inn serves as their meeting-place), but does not view them as a significant threat. 

Vistani Encampment. Strahd holds Arrigal as one of his favored spies. However, he pays little mind to the dusk elves— Kasimir especially—and has little interest in their affairs. 

Argynvostholt. Strahd views the revenants of the Order of the Silver Dragon with disinterested contempt, but has long since determined that the knights pose no threat to him, and has largely ignored them as a result. He has heard the rumors that Argynvost’s spirit haunts the manor, but pays them no mind; he would refuse to believe that the beacon of Argynvostholt could be relit even if told to his face. 

Wizard of Wines. Strahd is aware that the winery is a stronghold for the Keepers of the Feather, but does not view them as a significant threat. He has delegated their “discipline” to Ludmilla, ensuring that their insubordination and resistance will be properly punished. 


Strahd von Zarovich Roleplaying Strahd 

Strahd is cold and calculating, skilled in social manipulation and deception. As the adventure unfolds, his attitude toward the players shifts significantly. Though Strahd never conceals his nature or identity, this dynamic relationship manifests as 

three "roles" that he plays: the Gentleman, the Tyrant, and the Monster. 

The Gentleman 

When the players first enter Barovia, Strahd acts as the Gentleman—polished and poised, if somewhat sociopathic. He is welcoming, well-mannered, and insatiably curious. His goal—to learn the ins and outs of the players' minds, including their goals, strengths, and weaknesses. 

As the Gentleman, Strahd should flatter the players with his interest and curiosity, offend them with his arrogance and condescension, and disgust them with his disregard for human freedom. 

In this role, Strahd most often feels curious, amused, nostalgic, or disappointed. Consider channeling Hannibal Lecter (The Silence of the Lambs), Don Corleone (The Godfather), or Frank Underwood (House of Cards) when playing him. 

The Gentleman avoids clashes as much as he can, taking any player rudeness or defiance in stride. If pushed, he might send his minions to stop a player's physical attacks, but only as a last resort. 

The Tyrant 

When he learns that the players have relit the beacon of Argynvostholt at the conclusion Arc R: The Beacon of Argynvostholt, Strahd becomes the Tyrant—harsh, stern, and somewhat cruel. He keeps his cool and aloof demeanor, but treats the players less like guests and more like disappointing protégés. His goal—to push the players to their limits, testing their resilience and assessing their competence. 

As the Tyrant, Strahd should offend the players with his insults and condescension, and disgust them with his disregard for human life. 

In this role, Strahd most often feels disappointed, scornful, satisfied, amused, and contemptuous. Consider channeling Moriarty (Sherlock), Tywin Lannister (Game of Thrones), Severus Snape (Harry Potter), and Omni-Man (Invincible). 

The Tyrant never strikes first—but will dare defiant players to back their words with action. Should a player back down, Strahd mocks their resolve and capabilities. Any players who attack him, though, are met with a swift and ruthless response—though never a lethal one. 

The Monster 

When he first learns that the players have restored the blade of the Sunsword in Arc V: The Sunsword, Strahd abandons all pretense and becomes the Monster—a cold, unfeeling sociopath, described further in Roleplaying Strahd (p. 10). His goal—to achieve his goals, no matter the cost. 

Yester Hill. Strahd views the Forest Folk with disdain and some amusement. He finds their maddened worship to be more grating than gratifying, and views the modern generation as a poor shadow of their more distinguished forebears. He does find them to be useful tools, however, and knows that their “faith” is a necessary evil to ensure their continued loyalty. 

Village of Krezk. Strahd has little interest in Baron [[Root/Worlds/Barovia/NPCs/Dmitri Krezkov\|Dmitri Krezkov]] or the people of Krezk. He is, amused by the Abbot’s descent into madness and corruption. He intends to temporarily “play along” with the Abbot’s efforts to construct a flesh golem bride for him, but has no serious intention of accepting Vasilka when complete. 

Werewolf Den. Strahd finds [[Root/Worlds/Barovia/NPCs/Kiril Stoyanovich\|Kiril Stoyanovich]] to be a useful and loyal servant, if somewhat brutish and unsophisticated. He intends to keep Emil Toranescu, the pack’s former alpha, as a prisoner in his dungeons until Emil is sufficiently mad with starvation to be “tamed.” 

Tsolenka Pass. Strahd is peripherally aware that the Mountain Folk roam the Balinok Mountains, but—due to Elder Burebis’s protection—is unaware of the existence of their settlement Monsdav. He considers the Mountain Folk to be a lost and broken people and has no use for or interest in them. 

Amber Temple. Strahd respects [[Root/Worlds/Barovia/NPCs/Neferon\|Neferon]]’s dedication to protecting the temple and finds him to be a worthy guardian of the treasures contained within. He has historically had a collegial respect for Exethanter, but, after awakening from his own hibernation, was disappointed by Exethanter’s loss of memory—something Strahd has little interest in restoring. 

Castle Ravenloft. Strahd is amused by the efforts of his brides—Ludmilla Vilisevic, Anastrasya Karelova, and Volenta Popfsky—to placate and impress him. He is momentarily entertained by his newest consort, Escher, but has been distracted lately by other, grander designs. He views [[Root/Worlds/Barovia/NPCs/Rahadin\|Rahadin]] as his most loyal, trusted, and favored servant, but spares little mind to the other staff and occupants of the castle, including Cyrus Belview, [[Root/Worlds/Barovia/NPCs/Lief Lipsiege\|Lief Lipsiege]], the coven of witches, and his own vampire spawn. By contrast, Beucephalus is his favored “pet” and most valued tool. 

Strahd’s Goals 

Strahd’s primary goal is simple: to free himself and Barovia from the Mists. 

As a conqueror, Strahd craves new lands and the freedom —and power—to claim them. He seeks to restore his long-lost empire, with Castle Ravenloft and the valley of Barovia as its seat of power. 

To this end, he needs three things: a pacified kingdom, a host of loyal servants, and—most importantly—an escape plan. 

By defeating his servants and halting their schemes, the players can deny him the first; by defending Ireena Kolyana and resisting his temptations, they can also deny him the second. However, Strahd has plans within plans, and there is only one way to halt his final scheme: to destroy the vampire himself. 

Reclaiming the Valley 

When Strahd awoke from his century-long slumber, he found that much had changed. 

The people of Barovia had forgotten why they feared him, and their burgomasters no longer served him faithfully. His servants and consorts had dispersed across the valley in pursuit of their own schemes and whims, and the wilds themselves had somehow cleansed the stain of corruption. That, he knew, must be addressed. 

He moved quickly to reclaim the Forest Fane as his own, restoring its bond to the Heart of Sorrow once more. He bade [[Root/Worlds/Barovia/NPCs/Rahadin\|Rahadin]] to find staff and attendants for Castle Ravenloft, and to ensure that each of the keep’s occupants served their master’s will. And he summoned his brides and spawn to Castle Ravenloft, commanding them to spread his shadow across the valley once more. 

Since then, Strahd has broken the village of Barovia and brought the werewolf pack to heel. He seeks next to break the town of Vallaki and the village of Krezk, to discipline the so called “Keepers of the Feather,” and to capture the vampire hunter Dr. Rudolph van Richten. 

When his servants’ work is done, Strahd expects to look down from the Pillarstone of Ravenloft upon a faithful and fearful populace, its people subservient to the Devil of Castle Ravenloft once more. 

Renewing His Servants 

When Strahd awoke from his slumber, he found that many of his vampiric brides and other servants had dispersed across the valley, forgoing his dark will in favor of their own petty pursuits. He has quickly moved to correct this—but some doubts still remain. 

Strahd seeks assurances that, when he escapes Barovia, he will do so with an army that will heed his words and execute his will without error or hesitation. To this end, he has delegated many of his plots to reassert his authority to his servants. Should they succeed, they shall be exalted and placed in positions of authority beneath him; should they fail, they shall be locked in the crypts beneath Ravenloft for eternity. 

Strahd is always hungry for new talent, however, and is on the lookout for new generals to serve his conquests and fresh consorts to keep him entertained. When the players arrive in Barovia, he focuses his attention on those who are especially charismatic, arrogant, intelligent, cunning, or attractive, seeking to determine whether any among the party are worthy of serving him in undeath. 

Though Strahd has not said so expressly, his brides are well-aware of the risk of being replaced—a motivation that he hopes will fuel their efforts on his behalf. Strahd believes fully in the “survival of the fittest” and expects to see the strongest rise to the top. 

Escaping the Mists 

With [[Root/Worlds/Barovia/NPCs/Madam Eva\|Madam Eva]]’s reluctant guidance, Strahd has learned that the Grand Conjunction—a time when the barriers between worlds will be thinned, and the energies of the stars aligned—is a prime opportunity to free himself from the Dark Powers’ prison. 

To this end, Strahd has crafted an ambitious and dangerous ritual to escape the Mists, using the Heart of Sorrow as its conduit and anchor. This ritual has three necessary components: a power source, a control mechanism, and a catalyst. 


Beucephalus, Strahd’s nightmare steed 

Strahd’s vampiric brides, Ludmilla, Anastrasya, and Volenta 

Strahd’s vampire spawn, including his consort, Escher 

Undead servants, including zombies, Strahd zombies, and wights 

Loyal beasts, including Barovian bats, rats, wolves, and dire wolves 

The werewolf pack commanded by [[Root/Worlds/Barovia/NPCs/Kiril Stoyanovich\|Kiril Stoyanovich]] 

Vistani spies, including Eliza (at Tser Pool Encampment) and Arrigal (at the Vallaki encampment) 

The witches’ coven that dwells in Castle Ravenloft However, Strahd always faces the final battle alone. 

Whether by pride, fate, or mere coincidence, this fight is his to win—or lose.
