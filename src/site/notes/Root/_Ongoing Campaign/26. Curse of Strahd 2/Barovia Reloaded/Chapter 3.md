Act II Summary

_An adventure for five 4th-level characters._

In this arc, the players must locate and retrieve the Tome of Strahd from one of two locations, depending on which Tarokka card Madam drew in Tser Pool: the attic in Baron Vallakovich’s mansion or the master bedroom closet of Wachterhaus. To obtain the Tome, the players must somehow gain access to its hiding spot through subterfuge, infiltration, or by performing a task for Victor Vallakovich or Lady Wachter, respectively. Upon finding it, the players must either bypass the magical lock securing it or uncover the passphrase that unseals its secrets . . .

**What Happened to the Tome?**

One hundred years ago, Strahd used his Tome as a repository for his secret plans involving the Grand Conjunction and the Fanes of Barovia. When he began his hibernation amidst the crypts of Ravenloft, he did his best to hide his Tome away, safe from prying eyes. Nonetheless, it was found—by the **wereraven** Livius, who was searching for the legendary _Sigil of the Sun_ (later renamed the _Holy Symbol of Ravenkind_) while Lugdana and Ismark Antonovich kept the guardians of the castle occupied.

When the trio escaped the castle, Livius shared with them the Tome, wondering aloud which of Strahd’s secrets it might hold. Because they could not open its magical lock, however, Lugdana took the Tome to a bookbinder in Vallaki with a reputation for puzzle-solving and lockpicking, hoping that he might be able to open it instead.

Lugdana, however, was betrayed. The bookbinder’s apprentice—a scion of House Wachter—overheard their conversation and made plans to steal the Tome instead:

**_The Tome in Wachterhaus._** If the modern Tome is located within the master bedroom closet of Wachterhaus, the apprentice hid the Tome away in the bookbinder’s desk, then returned that night to steal it. The Tome has remained locked away in Wachterhaus ever since. (Because her parents died while she was still a teenager, Lady Fiona Wachter never learned of the Tome’s true origins.)

**_The Tome in the Baron's Mansion._** If the modern Tome is located within the attic of the Burgomaster’s mansion, the apprentice hid the Tome away in a pile of books with the intent to later return to steal it—but didn’t realize that that particular pile included an assortment of books that Baron Vallakovich’s ancestor had dropped off at the shop for re-binding. The pile of books was picked up later that day, before the apprentice could return and steal the Tome. The Tome itself was soon discarded and forgotten amongst the many items scattered in the Vallakovich attic, where it remained until Victor Vallakovich found it using the _detect magic_ spell. (Victor hasn’t been able to successfully unlock it yet, but is curious to know what the book contains.)

# D1. Burgomaster’s Mansion

## D1a. Entering the Mansion

_This scene takes place in Chapter 5: Area N3._

The players can gain access to the attic of the Burgomaster’s Mansion through persuasion or infiltration. See [F3a. Entering the Mansion](https://www.strahdreloaded.com/Act+II+-+The+Shadowed+Town/Arc+F+-+The+Missing+Vistana#F3a. Entering the Mansion) for more information. (Because the players are likely to visit the mansion on multiple occasions—either during [Arc F - The Missing Vistana](https://www.strahdreloaded.com/Act+II+-+The+Shadowed+Town/Arc+F+-+The+Missing+Vistana), [Arc G - Lady Wachter's Wish](https://www.strahdreloaded.com/Act+II+-+The+Shadowed+Town/Arc+G+-+Lady+Wachter's+Wish), [Arc H - The Strazni Siblings](https://www.strahdreloaded.com/Act+II+-+The+Shadowed+Town/Arc+H+-+The+Strazni+Siblings), or [Arc I - The Lost Soul](https://www.strahdreloaded.com/Act+II+-+The+Shadowed+Town/Arc+I+-+The+Lost+Soul)—it is likely that they will obtain the _Tome of Strahd_ on one such occasion.)

## D1b. Obtaining the Tome

_This scene takes place in Chapter 5: Area N3t._

The _Tome of Strahd_ can currently be found on the edge of [Victor Vallakovich's](https://www.strahdreloaded.com/Appendices/Non-Player+Characters#Victor Vallakovich) workdesk. A player viewing it through a _detect magic_ spell can see that it is surrounded by magic, and can use an action to discern that the magic is of the abjuration school.

Victor won’t relinquish the _Tome_ willingly. After finding it in his parents’ attic and recognizing the Von Zarovich crest, he is determined to one day unlock and read its contents. However, he is willing to surrender it to the players if they first help him restore the soul of Stella Wachter to her body. See [Arc I - The Lost Soul](https://www.strahdreloaded.com/Act+II+-+The+Shadowed+Town/Arc+I+-+The+Lost+Soul) for more information on this quest.

# D2. Wachterhaus

_This scene takes place in Chapter 5: Area N4._

As with the Burgomaster’s Mansion, the players can obtain the _Tome of Strahd_ in Wachterhaus through persuasion or infiltration.

Wachterhaus is largely as described in N4. Wachterhaus (p. 110), but with the following changes:

- Lady Wachter’s late husband, Nikolai, was buried in the cemetery after his death several years ago and is no longer in Lady Wachter’s bed in N4o. Master Bedroom (p. 113).
- Stella Wachter doesn't scratch at her door or call out to the players in N4l. Upstairs Hall (p. 113). If found, she is dull-eyed and non-responsive, incapable of speaking to the players or even moving of her own volition. (This is because she has lost her soul, which is currently trapped in the Ethereal Plane. See [Arc I - The Lost Soul](https://www.strahdreloaded.com/Act+II+-+The+Shadowed+Town/Arc+I+-+The+Lost+Soul) for more information.)
- Stella's room is neither musty nor dark, and her bed is not fitted with leather straps. Instead, her room is well-appointed, including a woven lavender rug, a comfortable armchair with floral patterns, and a small bookcase with a collection of carved wooden cats atop it. (The cats were whittled by her older brother, Karl, as get-well gifts following Stella’s illness.)
- The manuscript and treatise contained in the iron chest in N4q. Storage Room (p. 114) are now titled _Voices of the Mist_ (a religious text written by Lady Fiona Wachter attesting that the worship of Ezra, goddess of the Mists, can bring peace, understanding, and solemnity), and _The Grimoire of Night's Whispers_, a ritual book and religious text to Mother Night written by the witch Baba Lysaga.
- The high shelf in N4o. Master Bedroom (p. 113) also holds a thirteen-inch scale model of Wachterhaus, crafted of twigs, clay, and painted thatch.

Additionally, while Lady Wachter still has the statistics of a **priest**, she has a different list of prepared spells:

Cantrips (at will): _light, toll the dead, thaumaturgy_  
1st level (4 slots): _command, sanctuary, bane_  
2nd level (3 slots): _blindness/deafness, zone of truth, hold person_  
3rd level (2 slots): _animate dead, spirit guardians_

## D2a. Persuading Lady Wachter

The players can persuade [Lady Wachter](https://www.strahdreloaded.com/Appendices/Non-Player+Characters#Lady Fiona Wachter) to give them the _Tome of Strahd_ by:

- bargaining for it as a condition to killing Izek Strazni, or
- requesting it as a gift after killing Izek Strazni or restoring the soul of Lady Wachter’s daughter, Stella. (See [Arc I - The Lost Soul](https://www.strahdreloaded.com/Act+II+-+The+Shadowed+Town/Arc+I+-+The+Lost+Soul) for more information.)

**Profile: Lady Fiona Wachter**

**Roleplaying Information**  
**_Resonance._** Lady Wachter should inspire wariness for her loyalty to Strahd, grudging respect for her streak of pragmatic rationality, endearment for her dedication to her children, and pity for the tragedy of her family.

**_Emotions._** Lady Wachter most often feels concerned, apprehensive, irate, melancholic, satisfied, thoughtful, determined, stern, or (with her children) compassionate and loving.

**_Motivations._** Lady Wachter wants to keep Vallaki—and especially her children—safe from harm. To that end, she hopes to see Baron Vargas Vallakovich removed from power and to reassure Strahd von Zarovich that Vallaki is no danger to his rule.

**_Inspirations._** When playing Lady Wachter, channel Moiraine Damodred (The Wheel of Time), Olenna Tyrell (Game of Thrones), Minerva McGonagall (Harry Potter), and Lady Jessica (Dune).

**Character Information**  
**_Persona._** To the world, Lady Wachter is a cold, cunning, and cordial noblewoman. To those she trusts, Lady Wachter is a melancholic, wry, yet fiercely determined advocate for what she sees as the good of Vallaki. Only Lady Wachter herself appreciates the depth of love she feels for her children—and her shattered sense of faith and hope.

**_Morale._** In a fight, Lady Wachter would attempt to negotiate or flee, seeking any means necessary to quell hostilities, up to and including outright surrender. If necessary to save her life or those of her children, however, she would fight to the death with bitter ferocity.

**_Relationships._** Lady Wachter is the widow of the deceased Nikolai Wachter I, and the mother of Nikolai Wachter II, Karl Wachter, and Stella Wachter. She is the employer of the **spy** Ernst Larnak, and an outspoken critic of Baron Vargas Vallakovich.

Because Lady Wachter was an adolescent at the time of her family’s tragic death, her parents never had an opportunity to reveal to her the true nature and origins of the Tome. As a result, while Lady Wachter is aware that the sigil on the cover is the crest of House Zarovich, she has always assumed that the book itself is a record of House Wachter’s service to Strahd, rather than Strahd’s own journal.

If the players make explicit reference to an item kept “under lock and key,” or an item kept “with the bones of an ancient enemy,” Lady Wachter immediately knows that they’re referring to the _Tome of Strahd._

If she feels cordial toward the players, Lady Wachter plays coy, pretending to dismiss the idea of keeping “bones” in one’s home and slyly asking the players how they came upon such knowledge. If pressed further, however, she carefully concedes the _hypothetical_ existence of such a book and attempts to bargain with the players as a means of securing it.

If she feels warmly toward the players (e.g., because they have killed Izek for her), Lady Wachter instead gladly retrieves the Tome from her closet and presents it to them.

In either case, Lady Wachter warns the players that she cannot be held responsible for what the book contains. Before handing the Tome over, she also exacts a promise that the players tell no one of where they obtained it.

## D2b. Infiltrating the Estate

The players may choose to infiltrate Wachterhaus, rather than obtaining the Tome with Lady Wachter’s permission.

The NPCs in the mansion behave as follows:

- Lady Wachter can generally be found in N4p. Library (p. 113) in the mornings, N4i. Parlor (p. 112) in the afternoons, N4t. Cult Headquarters (p. 114) in the evenings, and N4o. Master Bedroom (p. 113) at night. (Lady Wachter is, however, a light sleeper; treat her passive Perception while asleep as the same as her passive Perception while awake.)
- Karl and Nikolai Wachter can generally be found in N4m. Brothers' Room (p. 113) in the mornings and late at night, and spend much of their remaining time out of the house carousing.
- Stella Wachter can generally be found sitting on a sofa in N4i. Parlor (p. 112) during the day, and lying in N4n. Stella's Room (p. 113) at night.
- Dhavit, Lady Wachter’s cook, can generally be found in N4c. Kitchen (p. 112) or N4d. Storage Room (p. 112) during the day, and N4h. Servants' Quarters (p. 113) at night.
- The four **cult fanatics** can be found in N4t. Cult Headquarters (p. 114) in the evening.
- Madalena, one of Lady Wachter’s maids, can generally be found on the first floor during the morning, in the gardens outside of the house in the afternoon, and in N4h. Servants’ Quarters (p. 113) at night.
- Amalthia, the other maid, can generally be found on the second floor during the morning, assisting Lady Wachter or Dhavit in the afternoons, and in N4h. Servants’ Quarters (p. 113) at night.
- Haliq, Lady Wachter’s valet, can generally be found assisting Lady Wachter in the mornings, running errands in town in the afternoons, and in N4h. Servants’ Quarters (p. 113) at night.
- Ernst, Lady Wachter’s spy, can generally be found in N4k. Den (p. 112) in the mornings, and spends much of his remaining time out of the house spying.

### 1. Raising the Alarm

Each of Lady Wachter’s servants carries a small, spherical wax bauble on a cord around their neck. Each wax bauble contains a small iron ingot carved with arcane runes. When a servant crushes or breaks the wax around their bauble and exposes the ingot to air, the runes flicker with grey light and cast a single _thaumaturgy_ spell, creating the sound of a crow’s caw that echoes through the house. If she is in the house, Lady Wachter hears the crow's caw and quickly moves to confront the intruders.

Alternatively, if the players activate the **skeleton** trap in N4s. Cellar (p. 114), Lady Wachter senses it and arrives from N4r. Cellar Entrance (p. 114) in the second round of combat to command any remaining skeletons to halt.

In either case, [Lady Wachter](https://www.strahdreloaded.com/Appendices/Non-Player+Characters#Lady Fiona Wachter) arrives with a crow (her disguised **imp**, Majesto) perched upon her shoulder, retaining a cool, diplomatic head at all times. (She doubts her ability to defeat the players through force, even with the aid of her cult, and prefers to resolve their differences peacefully. Despite her arcane power, Lady Wachter is no warrior.)

First, Lady Wachter greets the players warmly and asks them their business. If the players refuse to tell her what they’re looking for, she guesses aloud that, because they haven’t assassinated or kidnapped her yet, they’re not here on Baron Vallakovich’s orders, and are therefore looking for an item in her possession. (She further wonders aloud that it is either something incredibly valuable which they seek to steal to enrich themselves, or something non-valuable that they want, but which they don’t trust her to barter for.)

**If she has previously met the players at dinner and asked them to kill Izek**, Lady Wachter sadly mourns their lack of trust in her and notes that she had hoped to work with them, and in fact still does. She then offers to obtain the item that they seek if they are willing to speak with her as equals.

**If she has not met the players before**, Lady Wachter instead offers a bargain in exchange for the item that the players seek. (If the players express interest in such an arrangement, she offers their desired item in exchange for the head of Izek Strazni. Negotiations proceed as described in [G2d. The Vallakovich Problem](https://www.strahdreloaded.com/Act+II+-+The+Shadowed+Town/Arc+G+-+Lady+Wachter's+Wish#G2d. The Vallakovich Problem).)

**If the players indicate or imply that they don’t trust her**, Lady Wachter asks the players for their permission to cast two spells: one to ensure that they are alone and away from prying eyes, and one to prove to them that she is telling the truth. (If permission is granted, she immediately casts _detect evil and good_, her eyes flashing briefly gray as she confirms that none of Strahd’s undead servants are currently watching them.)

### 2. Lady Wachter’s Offer

The second spell that [Lady Wachter](https://www.strahdreloaded.com/Appendices/Non-Player+Characters#Lady Fiona Wachter) seeks to cast is _zone of truth,_ which she explains aloud to the players. To prove her credibility, she suggests casting the spell and stepping inside of it, permitting the players to question and interrogate her to their hearts’ content. By doing so, she hopes, they will be able to assuage any of their fears regarding her loyalty to Strahd.

Lady Wachter is more than glad to permit the players to tie her up during the interrogation, and even suggests that the players move their conversation to N4p. Library (p. 113) so that they may question her free from prying eyes and ears. She freely offers the key to the library—both so that the players can unlock the door and lock it behind them—and suggests that the players restrain her to a chair and hold a dagger to her throat if it puts them at greater ease.

If the players point out her extraordinary nonchalance, Lady Wachter asks them, quite mildly, if panicking or arguing would help her situation. “I am entirely at your mercy,” she observes. “Armed foreigners have broken into my house, evidently for nefarious or criminal purposes, and taken me prisoner. Would you have me fight back and die, or attempt to flee and be restrained nonetheless?”

If the players refuse Lady Wachter’s offer and continue their burglary, she makes no effort to resist them. If, however, the players accept Lady Wachter’s offer and choose to restrain her during the interrogation, she asks only that her hands be kept free, so that she may perform the somatic components necessary to cast _zone of truth._

Lady Wachter is well-aware that the players may not trust that her spell is legitimate. As such, she invites the players to test the spell in two ways: first, by stepping into the _zone of truth_ and experiencing its effects themselves; and second, by compelling her to share her deepest, darkest secrets.

If asked her secrets when under the effects of _zone of truth_, Lady Wachter shares any or all of the following pieces of information:

- She has intentionally gathered a conspiracy of Vallakians dedicated to the worship of Ezra, the goddess of the Mists. These conspirators are all fervently loyal to her and aim to overthrow Baron Vargas Vallakovich should Izek be killed.
- The cellar of Wachterhaus, the cult’s headquarters, is protected by nearly a dozen **skeletons**, which Fiona stole from the town cemetery and animated with dark magic.
- For one full year after her husband’s death, Fiona kept the corpse of her late husband, Nikolai, magically preserved in the bed of her master bedroom. (He eventually received a proper burial when she moved past her grief.)
- The crow upon Fiona’s shoulder is an **imp** named Majesto, who Fiona summoned and bound using the profane teachings of her mentor, the swamp witch Baba Lysaga.

If questioned regarding her allegiance to Strahd, Lady Wachter truthfully tells them the following:

- The Wachter family owes a debt of allegiance to Strahd, who rescued their ancestors from a slaughter many centuries ago.
- Lady Wachter herself considers Strahd to be a dangerous individual, but one whose temper can and must be managed and controlled through strategic shows of fealty.
- Lady Wachter will obey Strahd’s direct orders for as long as necessary to ensure the peace, prosperity, and safety of the people of Vallaki.
- Lady Wachter bears no ill will toward the players, even if they consider themselves to be enemies of Strahd, and will lift no hand against them unless compelled to do so.
- She has heard rumors from Strahd’s servants among the Vistani (relayed to her through her spy, Ernst) that he intends no harm toward the players, at least for now, and has in fact ordered that they be kept alive for his own purposes. (Lady Wachter isn’t sure why, and admits as much.)

If questioned regarding her proposed bargain, Lady Wachter truthfully tells them that she will provide them with the item they seek, if it is within her physical power to do so, as soon as Izek Strazni is dead. (She is glad to assist them in doing so. See [Arc G - Lady Wachter's Wish](https://www.strahdreloaded.com/Act+II+-+The+Shadowed+Town/Arc+G+-+Lady+Wachter's+Wish) for more information.)

If the players describe Madam Eva’s reading to her—specifically by mentioning an item “kept under lock and key” or “with the bones of an ancient enemy,” Lady Wachter instantly realizes that they are referring to the magical book locked in the trunk in the closet of N4o. Master Bedroom (p. 113) and promises to deliver it to them once they fulfill their end of the bargain.

If the players refuse her bargain, Lady Wachter takes no action to resist them, but will not disclose the Tome’s location under any circumstances, even under threat of physical harm. She remains cold and unhelpful toward the players for the remainder of the adventure (though she takes no actual hostile action against them), until and unless they restore the soul of her daughter, Stella. (See [Arc I - The Lost Soul](https://www.strahdreloaded.com/Act+II+-+The+Shadowed+Town/Arc+I+-+The+Lost+Soul) for more information.)

# D3. Unlocking the Tome

The _Tome of Strahd_ is kept closed by a locked steel clasp enchanted with an _arcane lock_ spell cast at 5th level. The pass phrase to suppress it is "I come in Dostron's memory." (Only Strahd and his eldest bride, Sasha Ivliskova, know this pass phrase. See [Arc L - Dinner with Strahd](https://www.strahdreloaded.com/Arc+L+-+Dinner+with+Strahd) for more information about Sasha Ivliskova.)

The clasp ordinarily takes a successful DC 15 Strength check to break, but requires a successful DC 25 Strength check instead while under the effects of the spell. Similarly, the lock itself ordinarily requires a DC 15 Dexterity (Thieves’ Tools) check to open, but requires a successful DC 25 Dexterity (Thieves’ Tools) check instead while under the effects of the spell. An attempt to pick the lock takes 1 minute to complete.

The lock is also enchanted with a magical trap. A character that fails to break, pick, or dispel the lock must make a DC 19 Constitution saving throw, taking 10 (3d6) necrotic damage on a failure or half as much on a success.

## Reading the Tome

Once successfully opened, the contents of the _Tome_ now read as follows: [6](https://www.reddit.com/r/CurseofStrahd/comments/i4euxw/plaything_of_darkness_a_philosophy_students_take/)

I am the Ancient. I am the Land. My beginnings are lost in the darkness of the past. I was the warrior, I was good and just. I thundered across the land like the wrath of a just god, but the war years and the killing years wore down my soul as the wind wears stone into sand.

All goodness slipped from my life. I found my youth and strength gone, and all I had left was death. My army settled in the valley of Barovia and took power over the people in the name of a just god, but with none of a god's grace or justice.

I called for my family, long unseated from their ancient thrones, and brought them here to settle in the castle Ravenloft. They came with a younger brother of mine, Sergei. He was handsome and youthful. I hated him for both.

From the families of the valley, one spirit shone above all others: a rare beauty, who was called 'perfection,' 'joy,' and 'treasure.' Her name was Tatyana, and I longed for her to be mine. But 'Old One' was my name to her—'elder' and 'brother' also. Her heart went to Sergei. They were betrothed. The date was set.

With words she called me "brother," but when I looked into her eyes they reflected another name: "death." It was the death of the aged that she saw in me. She loved her youth and enjoyed it, but I had squandered mine. And so I came to hate death—my death.

But I would not be called "death" so soon. I made a pact with Death. On the day of the wedding, I killed Sergei, my brother, and sealed my pact with his blood.

I found Tatyana weeping in the garden east of the chapel. She fled from me, and I pursued. Finally, in despair, she flung herself from the walls of Ravenloft, and I watched everything I ever wanted fall from my grasp forever.

It was a thousand feet through the mists. No trace of her was ever found, and not even I know her final fate. Arrows from the castle guards pierced me to my soul, but I did not die. Nor did I live. I became undead, forever.

I have studied much since then. 'Vampyr' is my new name. I still lust for life and youth, and I curse the living that took them from me. Even the sun is against me, but little else can harm me now. Even a stake through my heart does not kill me, though it holds me from movement. But the sword, that cursed sword that Sergei brought! I must dispose of that awful tool! I fear and hate it as much as the sun.

I have learned much, too, about this land of Barovia. Ancient are its ways, ancient beyond the knowledge of the simple folk of the valley. Ancient gods dwelt in this valley long before my coming, and three hidden fanes still give tribute to their memories. I visited the Swamp Fane, the Forest Fane, and the Mountain Fane, and claimed their power for my own. Their servants now serve me, and thus I have become the Land.

Since my passage into eternity, I have often hunted for Tatyana. I have even felt her within my grasp, but each time, she flees from me again. But she cannot run forever—and I have nothing but time.

I now reside far below Ravenloft. I live among the dead and sleep beneath the very stones of this hollow castle of despair. I have abandoned the riches of my conquests beneath the toll of the belfry, sealed behind a reminder of the treasure I once lost. Yet one day, I shall rise again from the ashes of my glory, and reclaim what is rightfully mine.

The pages following the legible text are filled with diagrams, equations, and thousands of strange symbols. The symbols are not written language, but a cipher devised by Strahd to conceal his secret plans. (Only the **lich** Exethanter knows the key to decode Strahd's cipher. See [Arc T - The Amber Temple](https://www.strahdreloaded.com/Arc+T+-+The+Amber+Temple) for more information about Exethanter.) Several diagrams appear to depict a large, crystalline human heart, while others depict circles of standing stones.

Players who read through these sections find numerous annotations referencing (in Common) an individual named Exethanter. Multiple instances of Exethanter’s name are accompanied by the symbol of the Amber Temple: a thick-bordered equilateral triangle containing an inverted equilateral triangle, which in turn contain a vertical wavy line. (The triangle represents the god of secrets, the inverted triangle the amber sarcophagi, and the wavy line the vestiges sealed within.)

**The Symbol**

The symbol of the Amber Temple can be identified by the dusk elf Kasimir Velikov (who has seen it in his dreams), by the revenant Sir Godfrey Gwilym (who once guarded the Temple), or by Victor Vallakovich (who has seen the symbol in his spellbook). Of these three, only Kasimir and Godfrey know what the Amber Temple is and where it can be found, and only Kasimir—once the players complete **_Arc P - The Beacon of Argynvostholt_**—is willing to tell them how to get there.

# Design Notes: The Tome of Strahd

This arc has been intentionally written to draw the players into one of Vallaki's two largest arcs: **_Arc I: The Lost Soul_** (if the _Tome_ is located within Victor Vallakovich's workroom) or **_Arc G: Lady Wachter's Wish_** (if the _Tome_ is located within Lady Wachter's master bedroom closet).

**_What Happened to the Tome?_** This brief history of the _Tome_ aims to explain how it was retrieved from Strahd's castle, tying it together with the history of the _Holy Symbol of Ravenkind_ and providing two possible alternative paths that it took once retrieved.

**_Burgomaster's Mansion._** The _Tome_ has been placed to encourage the players to interact with Victor and to naturally entice them to begin **_Arc I: The Lost Soul._**

**_Wachterhaus._** The _Tome_ has been placed to encourage the players to interact with Lady Wachter and to naturally entice them to begin **_Arc G: Lady Wachter's Wish_**.

Should the players decide to steal the _Tome_ from Lady Wachter (e.g., because they mistrust her as a servant of Strahd), this section has been written to provide Lady Wachter with a believable and in-character approach to winning the players' trust, while introducing her relationship to the cult and Baba Lysaga (both of which will prove essential later on in **_Arc I: The Lost Soul_**).

**_Unlocking the Tome._** The _Tome of Strahd_ has been made somewhat more difficult to open in order to ensure that the players have an appreciate for the importance of its contents, and to explain why Victor Vallakovich and Lady Wachter are ignorant of its content. (The _Tome_ should generally be simple to open, though some parties may be unable to do so until learning or preparing _dispel magic_ upon reaching 5th level. Parties unable to do so might be able to obtain the aid of Sasha Ivliskova in doing so in **_Arc L: Dinner With the Devil_**).

The Tome's contents have been revised to foreshadow the existence of the Fanes of the Ladies Three and to guide the players to Ravenloft's hidden treasury, which they will have an opportunity to raid in **_Arc T: Ravenloft Heist_**. The Tome has also been revised for tone in order to remove traces of romantic sentiment and to make Strahd's cold, predatory, and sociopathic character more apparent.

The _Tome_ also contains a coded section discussing Strahd's plot to escape the Mists, as well as the means by which Strahd corrupted the Fanes of Barovia. This section has been included to ensure that the _Tome_ remains useful to the players through the latter portions of the campaign, ensuring that it retains equal weight to the _Sunsword_ and _Holy Symbol of Ravenkind._

This guide intentionally foregoes any other additions to the _Tome_, including any modifications that implement its history as "visions" that the players can experience or any modifications that turn the _Tome_ into a combat-ready item.

In the former case, this guide aims to keep Strahd as a pseudo-mythic figure whose exploits are less seen than heard, and works to lay the seeds of his past as quickly as possible to drive the plot forward and build player intrigue, rather than sowing them slowly over the course of many sessions.

In the latter case, Madam Eva's reading regarding the _Tome of Strahd_ specifically states that "Knowledge of the ancient will help you better _understand_ your enemy," not that knowledge will assist them in _defeating_ him. The _Tome_ is unique in that its value is derived from _knowledge_, not martial power. This guide seeks to preserve that uniqueness. (In addition, in a campaign built upon defeating Strahd through defying his philosophy—selfishness—it would be a strange thing indeed for the players to defeat Strahd through a tool of his own making.)

(The triangle represents the god of secrets, the circles the amber sarcophagi, and the wavy line the vestiges sealed within.) 

The symbol can be identified by the dusk elf [[Root/Worlds/Barovia/NPCs/Kasimir Velikov\|Kasimir Velikov]] (who has seen it in his dreams), by the revenant Sir [[Root/Worlds/Barovia/NPCs/Godfrey Gwilym\|Godfrey Gwilym]] (who once guarded the Temple), or by Victor Vallakovich (who has seen the symbol in his spellbook). 

# Adventure Organization 

While Curse of [[Root/Worlds/Barovia/NPCs/Strahd von Zarovich\|Strahd]], like most official campaign modules, is organized around specific areas and locations, Curse of [[Root/Worlds/Barovia/NPCs/Strahd von Zarovich\|Strahd]]: Reloaded is organized around narratives: 

Acts. An act is a collection of adventures with similar settings and stakes that are meant to be completed in approximately the same timeframe (e.g., "adventures in [[Root/Worlds/Barovia/Locations/Vallaki\|Vallaki]]"). 

Arcs. An arc is a high-concept adventure within an act that has a particular goal (e.g., "restore the bones of Saint [[Root/Worlds/Barovia/NPCs/Andral\|Andral]]"). 

Chapters. A chapter is a portion of an arc that takes place within a particular location (e.g., "the coffin-maker's shop"). 

Scenes. A scene is a particular scene that unfolds at a particular time and place within a chapter (e.g., "battling the [[Resources/Rules/One P[[Holy Symbol of Ravenkind\|iece 5e/DM Screen/Lists_]]Tables/Spellcasting/S-V/Symbol|vampir]]e spawn"). 

The [[Root/Resources/Equipment/Artifacts/Holy Symbol of Ravenkind\|Holy Symbol of Ravenkind]] has been revised as follows: 

[[Root/Resources/Equipment/Artifacts/Holy Symbol of Ravenkind\|Holy Symbol of Ravenkind]] 

The holy symbol has 5 charges for the following properties. It regains 1d4 + 1 charges daily at dawn. 

Dawn's Embrace. As a reaction, when a creature you can see within 60 feet of you would be reduced to 0 hit points, you can expend 1 charge to cause that creature to drop to 1 hit point instead. That creature gains immunity to all damage until the start of its next turn. 

Light of Hope. As an action, you can expend 1 charge and choose one creature you can see within 30 feet of you. All of the following conditions on that creature end: blinded, charmed, deafened, frightened, paralyzed, poisoned, and stunned. 

Sun’s Blessing. As an action, you can expend 3 charges to cause holy power to radiate from the symbol in a 30-foot radius for 1 minute. Nonhostile creatures in that radius deal an extra 1d4 radiant damage when they hit with a weapon attack. 

You can also use the holy symbol as a spellcasting focus for your cleric and paladin spells. You gain a +1 bonus to spell attack rolls and to the saving throw DCs of your cleric and paladin spells. 

**The Sunsword** 

The Sunsword cannot be attuned to when the players first obtain it. Instead, the players must submerge it in the blessed pool near the [[Root/Worlds/Barovia/Locations/Shrine of the White Sun\|Shrine of the White Sun]] to restore its radiant blade. (The hilt retains its sentience and ability to communicate telepathically before its blade is restored.) For more information about this arc, see Arc V: The [[Root/Resources/Equipment/Weapons/Sunsword\|Sunsword]] below. 

Note that [[Root/Resources/Equipment/Weapons/Sunsword\|the Suns]]word is a sentient magic item; as described in Conflict (Dungeon Master's Guide, p. 216), it may make demands of its wielder or attempt to seize control of them if they act contrary to its will. (This is especially likely to occur if, for example, its wielder is charmed by [[Root/Worlds/Barovia/NPCs/Strahd von Zarovich\|Strahd von Zarovich]].) 

**[[Root/Worlds/Barovia/NPCs/Strahd von Zarovich\|Strahd]]’s Enemy** 

[[Root/Worlds/Barovia/NPCs/Strahd von Zarovich\|Strahd]]'s enemy no longer possesses the Inspire action ([[Root/Worlds/Barovia/NPCs/Strahd von Zarovich\|Strahd]]'s Enemy, p. 15). Instead, if she confronts the [[Root/Worlds/Barovia/Factions/Dark Powers\|Dark Powers]] at [[Root/Worlds/Barovia/NPCs/Marina\|Marina]]'s Monument in [[Root/Worlds/Barovia/Locations/Berez\|Berez]] (see Arc X: Whispers of the Mists), [[Root/Worlds/Barovia/NPCs/Ireena Kolyana\|Ireena Kolyana]] gains this ability as a bonus action. See Arc B: Welcome to [[Root/Worlds/Barovia/Locations/Barovia\|Barovia]] for more information about [[Root/Worlds/Barovia/NPCs/Ireena Kolyana\|Ireena]]'s statistics. 

**The Card Reading** 

Immediately before the scene in which the players meet [[Root/Worlds/Barovia/NPCs/Madam Eva\|Madam Eva]], if you are using a physical Tarokka deck for the reading, choose which five cards [[Root/Worlds/Barovia/NPCs/Madam Eva\|Madam Eva]] will draw and stack them on top of the deck in the order described in Card Reading (p. 11). 

The [[Root/Resources/Equipment/Books, Texts/Tome of Strahd\|Tome of Strahd]] 

Place the [[Root/Resources/Equipment/Books, Texts/Tome of Strahd\|Tome of Strahd]] in one of the following locations: 

Nine of Swords—Torturer. Choose the attic of the Burgomaster's mansion in [[Root/Worlds/Barovia/Locations/Vallaki\|Vallaki]] if you want to give the players a reason to befriend or antagonize [[Root/Worlds/Barovia/NPCs/Baron Vargas Vallakovich\|Baron Vargas Vallakovich]]. (If you do, the Tome has been relocated[[Root/Worlds/Barovia/NPCs/Victor Vallakovich\| in Victor Vallako]]vich’s workroom within the attic.) 

Nine of Glyphs—Traitor. Choose the master bedroom of [[Root/Worlds/Barovia/Locations/Wachterhaus\|Wachterhaus]] if you want to give the players a reason to befriend or antagonize Lady [[Root/Worlds/Barovia/NPCs/Fiona Wachter\|Fiona Wachter]]. 

Strahd's Enemy 

Assign the role of [[Root/Worlds/Barovia/NPCs/Strahd von Zarovich\|Strahd]]'s Enemy to [[Root/Worlds/Barovia/NPCs/Ezmerelda\|Ezmerelda]] d'Avenir (Mists—Queen of Spades). 


Design Notes: The Tarokka Reading 

The [[Root/Resources/Equipment/Books, Texts/Tome of Strahd\|Tome of Strahd]]. The [[Root/Resources/Equipment/Books, Texts/Tome of Strahd\|Tome of Strahd]] has been expanded to provide the players with secret information about [[Root/Worlds/Barovia/NPCs/Strahd von Zarovich\|Strahd]]'s ultimate plan, as well as additional hooks to the Fanes of [[Root/Worlds/Barovia/Locations/Barovia\|Barovia]] and the [[Root/Worlds/Barovia/Locations/Amber Temple\|Amber Temple]]. (If the players restore his memory and show him the Tome, the lich Exethanter can interpret Strahd's ciphers and notes at their request.) 

The Tome has been intentionally placed in Vallaki to ensure that the players find it (and are intrigued by its mysteries) as early as possible. Because they tie strongly into other quests, Rictavio's wagon (Seven of Stars—Illusionist) and the attic of the Blue Water Inn (Master of Coins— Rogue) have been removed as possible locations. 


Strahd’s Spies 

One or more of Strahd's spies check in on the players once each day and once each night, as described in Strahd's Spies (p. 29). However, the nature of Strahd’s spies may vary with the players’ location and the time of day. 

Due to its power in combat against Strahd, the Sunsword has been intentionally placed in the Amber Temple—the most dangerous and isolated location in the game—to ensure that the players do not obtain it too early. This placement also ensures that the players have a reliable hook to the Temple and a rewarding goal to achieve while there. 

Strahd's Enemy. All possible allies other than the Vistana 

Strahd's spies report the following information, which you should track using the Strahd's Espionage handout on the end of his guide: 

any conversations that the players are heard having; 

any spells, weapons, or abilities that the players are seen using; and 

any locations or NPCs that the players are seen visiting. 


Encounters with Strahd 

Throughout the adventure, the players will have numerous encounters with Strahd von Zarovich. After meeting Strahd for the first time at the River Ivlis Crossroads (see Arc C: Into the Valley), the players may later speak with him at Yester Hill (see Arc M: The Missing Gem) and dine with him at Castle Ravenloft (see Arc L: Dinner with Strahd). 

Once Strahd learns that the players have obtained the Holy Symbol of Ravenkind or relit the beacon of Argynvostholt, he refocuses his efforts toward determining whether any of them are worthy to serve as generals or consorts in his court. 
monster hunter Ezmerelda d'Avenir have intentionally been removed from the Tarokka reading. 

## Barovia Plots

### Doru
While at the local church, the players meet Doru, a vampire spawn at war with his bloodthirsty nature, and have an opportunity to reconcile him with his father, the priest [[Root/Worlds/Barovia/NPCs/Donavich\|Donavich]]. 

### Vistani
Upon receiving a warning and invitation sent in a dream from the Vistani seer [[Root/Worlds/Barovia/NPCs/Madam Eva\|Madam Eva]], the players depart the village of Barovia for a Vistani encampment at nearby Tser Pool. Following a brief encounter with Strahd himself, the players receive a mystical Tarokka reading from [[Root/Worlds/Barovia/NPCs/Madam Eva\|Madam Eva]], who foretells the location of three mystical artifacts—and a companion—who will help them defeat Strahd. 

As the players travel to [[Root/Worlds/Barovia/NPCs/Madam Eva\|Madam Eva]]'s camp and the nearby town of Vallaki, they encounter a number of characters with ties to possible future adventures, as well as some adversarial encounters that will test their tactics, coordination, and combat skill. 

**Arabelle** This vistani child wants a toy from vallaki? Drowned child? 

## Vallaki Plots

The Players meet new allies and enemies, including Father Lucian, the priest of St. Andral's Church; [[Root/Worlds/Barovia/NPCs/Izek Strazni\|Izek Strazni]], Baron Vallakovich's brutal enforcer; and Lady [[Root/Worlds/Barovia/NPCs/Fiona Wachter\|Fiona Wachter]], the Baron's Strahd-loyalist rival. 
### Father Lucian
At St. Andral's Church, the players will be tasked with recovering the stolen bones of St. Andral in order to protect the church's holy protection. 
### Arabelle 
At the nearby Vistani encampment, the players will have an opportunity to prove themselves heroes by finding and rescuing Arabelle following her mysterious disappearance—and receive a mysterious prophecy if they do. 
### Izek
At Wachterhaus, the ancestral home of House Wachter, the players will be given a choice: slay [[Root/Worlds/Barovia/NPCs/Izek Strazni\|Izek Strazni]] and allow Lady Wachter to seize power—or do nothing, and allow the Baron's mad reign to continue. 
### Blood Tax
If the players assisted Lady [[Root/Worlds/Barovia/NPCs/Fiona Wachter\|Fiona Wachter]] in becoming Burgomaster in Act II, Vallaki's forthcoming "Blood Tax" can provide a night on which Strahd will be absent from the castle—and therefore present a perfect opportunity for a heist. 
### Stella Wachter
Meanwhile, one of the players begins to experience haunting apparitions, leading them to discover the tragic fate of Stella Wachter's soul—and an opportunity to restore her broken mind. Simultaneously, a nocturnal killer haunts Vallaki's streets, secretly working to drive the disguised vampire hunter Dr. Rudolph van Richten out of hiding. 
### Tome of Strahd
Through it all, the players will have an opportunity to seek out clues leading to the hidden location of the [[Root/Resources/Equipment/Books, Texts/Tome of Strahd\|Tome of Strahd]], which—depending on the Tarokka reading they received—may be hidden in the Baron's mansion or in Wachterhaus. 

## Krezk
### Ilya
Assist Baron [[Root/Worlds/Barovia/NPCs/Dmitri Krezkov\|Dmitri Krezkov]] in finding and rescuing his son, Ilya—a secret werewolf like his father— from the hidden werewolf den nearby. 
### Emil
Meet [[Root/Worlds/Barovia/NPCs/Zuleika Toranescu\|Zuleika Toranescu]], a werewolf priestess of Mother Night who asks them to rescue her mate, [[Root/Worlds/Barovia/NPCs/Emil Toranescu\|Emil]], from the dungeons of Castle Ravenloft.
### Abbots wedding dress
Accept the Abbot's request to obtain a wedding dress from Vallaki in exchange for his resurrection magic, the spirit of Saint Markovia warns them that he has fallen from grace and that they must obtain the holy symbol of the cleric Tasha Petrovna from the catacombs of Ravenloft in order to restore him. 
### Kasimir
[[Root/Worlds/Barovia/NPCs/Kasimir Velikov\|Kasimir Velikov]], a dusk elf mage, is currently trying to get a way to find the the mysterious Amber Temple and has attempted to visit it in the recent past.  In this act, the players journey with the dusk elf [[Root/Worlds/Barovia/NPCs/Kasimir Velikov\|Kasimir Velikov]] to the Amber Temple, traveling along Tsolenka Pass as they ascend Mount Ghakis.

## Soldav

### Friends in high places
As they do, they can befriend the Mountain Folk of Soldav, including Elder Burebis, an ancient storm giant and devotee of the Ladies Three. From Burebis, the players can learn of the three Fanes of Barovia, and of the profane knowledge that Strahd took from the Amber Temple to desecrate them. 

After overcoming the trials of Mount Ghakis's slopes, including Strahd's chamberlain [[Root/Worlds/Barovia/NPCs/Rahadin\|Rahadin]], the giant goat Sangzor, multiple fiends corrupted by the Amber Temple, and the roc of Mount Ghakis itself, the players can finally arrive at their destination. Within the Amber Temple, the players can obtain the broken hilt of the Sunsword, as well as the arcane secrets that Strahd used to corrupt the Barovian Fanes—and which can, in turn, be used to restore them. 

### Godfrey Gwilym
Should the players visit Argynvostholt, the former headquarters of the Order of the Silver Dragon, they can learn the ancient history of the Order—and the nature of its current schism. From Sir [[Root/Worlds/Barovia/NPCs/Godfrey Gwilym\|Godfrey Gwilym]], they can also learn that [[Root/Worlds/Barovia/NPCs/Kasimir Velikov\|Kasimir Velikov]], a dusk elf mage, shares an interest in the mysterious Amber Temple and has attempted to visit it in the recent past. 

## Village of Barovia

### Strahds Brides
If the players infiltrate Castle Ravenloft, they can recover Argynvost's skull from the Hall of Bones, Emil Toranescu from the castle dungeons, and [[Root/Worlds/Barovia/NPCs/Tasha Petrovna\|Tasha Petrovna]]'s holy symbol from the catacombs beneath the castle. Along the way, they'll likely do battle with any or all of Strahd's brides. 

## Argynvostholt

### Argynvost
The spirit of Argynvost himself will set them a dangerous task: to recover his remains. By returning Argynvost's skull to Argynvostholt, the players can relight the beacon of the Order of the Silver Dragon, bringing hope to the valley and allowing the revenants' spirits to find peace. By rescuing Emil, they can gain a powerful ally in defeating the current leader of the werewolf pack, [[Root/Worlds/Barovia/NPCs/Kiril Stoyanovich\|Kiril Stoyanovich]], and win the Holy Symbol of Ravenkind. Finally, by obtaining [[Root/Worlds/Barovia/NPCs/Tasha Petrovna\|Tasha Petrovna]]'s holy symbol and defeating the Abbot in combat, the players can restore the grace of his divine spirit, providing Krezk with a mighty protector. 

### Festival of the Blazing Sun
And as the date of the Festival of the Blazing Sun approaches, [[Root/Worlds/Barovia/NPCs/Izek Strazni\|Izek Strazni]] and Ireena Kolyana grow closer to a fateful, yet tragic encounter. 

### Wizard of the Wines Winery
If the players agree to Urwin's request, they are joined by [[Root/Worlds/Barovia/NPCs/Muriel Martikov\|Muriel Vinshaw]]—the secret identity of the disguised wereraven that they rescued near Tser Pool. As the players work to free the winery from the scourge of druids and blights that have invaded it, Muriel relays an excerpt of Strahd's foretelling to Davian Martikov, an elder wereraven and the leader of the Keepers of the Feather. 

### Yester Hill 
Upon freeing the winery from the druids' clutches, Davian asks them to journey to Yester Hill to the south, where the druids are plotting a dark ritual that threatens the vineyard's destruction. Upon defeating the druids, the players will have an opportunity to speak with Strahd by the Whispering Wall and to learn of the hidden settlement of Soldav from Kavan, the spirit of an ancient Mountain Folk chieftain. The tree blight Wintersplinter destroys the winery if the druids' ritual isnt stopped in time.

### Green Gem
Once the players have recovered the winery's stolen gemstone and returned it to Davian Martikov, they can learn the true nature of the Keepers of the Feather and gain Muriel's knowledge of Strahd's cryptic fortunetelling. 


### Dinner with Strahd
Should the players accept Strahd's invitation to dine at Ravenloft, they will be escorted by Strahd's black carriage to the castle, where they will meet Strahd's servants, brides, and consorts. After dining with Strahd himself and learning of the castle's history, the players will have an opportunity to tour the castle, to dance with Strahd's brides, and—if they choose—to solve a brief mystery on Strahd's behalf. 


## Amber Temple
### Friends in Low Places
Upon restoring the memory of the lich Exethanter and sharing with him the schematics found in the [[Root/Resources/Equipment/Books, Texts/Tome of Strahd\|Tome of Strahd]], the players can also learn Strahd's ultimate plan: to channel the power of the Fanes into the indestructible Heart of Sorrow within Castle Ravenloft, which Strahd will use to tear open the Mists and escape. The players will also learn that Strahd plans to consume the souls of all Barovia in order to power his audacious scheme, and that he cannot ever truly be killed unless severed from the Fanes' power. 
### Sunbreak
With the broken hilt of the Sunsword in their hands, the players are called by a mysterious voice to return to the Shrine of the White Sun in Krezk. There, they can meet the spirit of [[Root/Worlds/Barovia/NPCs/Sergei von Zarovich\|Sergei von Zarovich]], who offers to use the power of the blessed pool to restore the Sunsword's radiant blade. 
### Sergei
If Ireena still accompanies the players, [[Root/Worlds/Barovia/NPCs/Sergei von Zarovich\|Sergei]] invites her to take sanctuary with him—an offer which she denies if the players have treated her with kindness and courage. If she rejects him, [[Root/Worlds/Barovia/NPCs/Sergei von Zarovich\|Sergei]] advises Ireena to journey to the ruined manor in Berez, where a wandering spirit can help her learn the true nature of Strahd's curse—and her own. 

Soon after descending Mount Ghakis, the players also learn that the swamp-witch Baba Lysaga has sealed the Wizard of Wines and Blue Water Inn within dual mirage arcane spells and taken [[Root/Worlds/Barovia/NPCs/Muriel Martikov\|Muriel Vinshaw]] prisoner at her creeping hut—and that she plans to return with an army of wereraven-slaying strix to exterminate the Keepers of the Feather for good. 

## Berez
In Berez, the players can do battle with [[Root/Worlds/Barovia/NPCs/Baba Lysaga\|Baba Lysaga]], freeing Muriel and the swarms of other ravens that Baba Lysaga has kept captive. Should the players bring Ireena to Marina's Monument nearby, they can also encounter the ghost of Burgomaster [[Root/Worlds/Barovia/NPCs/Lazlo Ulrich\|Lazlo Ulrich]], the father of Marina Ulrich—one of Ireena's past lives. 

## Marina
Ulrich can guide the party to Marina's Monument within the swamp, where Ireena can experience the deaths of her past lives and learn the terrible truth: that, in order to escape Strahd's predation, each of her past lives ultimately accepted the gift of the Dark Powers themselves—the oblivion of death. With the players' aid, Ireena can defy the Dark Powers' temptations and reclaim a power of defiance and hope. 

## Fanes

In this act, the players reconsecrate the Swamp Fane, the Mountain Fane, and the Forest Fane. Soon after the last Fane is restored, however, Strahd's masterstroke unfolds. By releasing the stored energy bound within the Heart of Sorrow, Strahd plunges Barovia into an eternal night—and turns the valley itself into desecrated ground. 

As an undead apocalypse threatens to overwhelm the Barovian people, the players must journey to Castle Ravenloft to face Strahd at the Heart of Sorrow. As the final battle unfolds, the Heart of Sorrow shows visions of Strahd's undead siege from across Barovia—and of the heroic resistance shown by the allies and friends that the players have made across their journey: 

### Sunrise
Should the players defeat Strahd, the Mists vanish and the sun rises over Barovia once again—a free land, at long last.
