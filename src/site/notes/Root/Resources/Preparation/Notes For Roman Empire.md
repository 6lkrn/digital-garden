DEFINITELY READ ASTRIX AND PLAY ASSASSINS CREED

I QUICKLY TypE THIS ON THE TRAIN SO SORRY FOR ANY TYPOS

Notes for tauhus campaign

  

Suggestions: 

-   Don't set it in historically accurate rome, set in a fantasy rome, with unique chars and  magic
    

-   Use the pathfinder module, but don't steal the plot points, just steal the world building and the politics and political figures
    
-   Make the head of the family a stern, commanding npc. They give orders and the party has to follow them. 
    

  

World Ideas

-   Rome has a lot of political room
    
-   In the city, there's old politicians and rich merchants. They live in the city only because it is the center of what's happening. Most of them live on villas in the hills surrounding the actual city. Many have Holiday homes around Italy. 
    
-   Citizenship  is heavily regulated  and limited to members of the city of Rome only. Eventually it would be extended to other cities in Italy, but not at the start. Everyone is considered an auxiliary force or ally. 
    
-   Rome controls the lands of everyone they rule over, this leads to non-citizens feeling very  unrepresented because they dont have a say in the senate but must still follow Roman laws.
    
-   There are multiple fronts of war at any one time. The time period I would recommend  is the lifetime of caesar. But usually they would always be fighting tribes in Spain, Germany, Gaul and north africa. 
    
-   Their main rival is Parthia in Persia. Here Rome maintains a lot of client states so they can have influence over the region even though they can't extend their influence so far away from their center of power. These clients are half loyal, half not. 
    
-   Most of Rome's territory was violently conquered so there's heavy mistrust between the conquered and the conquerors. This is made worse by the lack of citizenships and rights granted to the new members of the empire.
    
-   Rome is a serene, complex, civilisation force throughout the world. The trade and luxuries they bring are big bribes for the rich and powerful of the tribal worlds. Rome has  access to the resources of the world, and the rich like to consume these delicacies with a hunger and greed that would shock any normal person. 
    
-   Rome is the center of the world and overpopulated beyond belief. With a million citizens, the sheer number of humans gathered within its walls would shock any visiting tribes man. 
    
-   Accordingly, the biggest issues in Rome are overpopulation, over construction, hygiene, fires, disease and riots. 
    
-   The population are big fans of blood sport. Chariot racing, Gladiator combats, back street brawls. 
    
-   The rich like bribing the citizens with grain and other grants of rations. The poor struggle and the empire similarly struggles to provide for the sheer  demand of its citizens
    
-   The empire faces many issues. What to do with its many allies, subjects and protectorates. How to support its overexpanded and strained empire. How to integrate new lands and subjects into its ranks. How to deal with the corrupt leaders and the movers and shakers of the nation.
    

  

Nobility

-   The nobility measures its prestige with a singular measure, how far back your lineage went. 
    
-   Every single member of the nobility is obsessed with one thing, glory. How to get it and how to kill others who had too much of it. 
    
-   While the nobles consider themselves far above the common man, they still fear the rise of an emperor. They are far more happy with power belonging to the few rather than a single man. Rome has not forgotten the last time it had a king and tyrant. 
    
-   Nobles serve in a wide range of pupblic positions. This ranges from administration tasks within the empire to military postings to priestly duties. 
    
-   Nobles spend a lot of bribes to get these positions and then turn around to leverage these positions for even more money so they can fill their coffers.

The ceremonies and culture of rome:  
Rome is in essencethe center of the universe and has the unprecedented wealth of the universe. The citizens are accustomed to a high quality oflife and luxury. This means constant holidays, feasts and  other events. The arts flourish in the city as entertainment can be found on anny cornerof the city. But beyond that, all the artisans belong to guilds. These were called the collegia or the collegia opificum. The purpose of these were for entreprenuers and rich merchants to protect  their interests from the government. Eventually they wouldbe made mandatory for the skilled citizens of the city. This sort of association extended to every corner of society. From thieves to tailors to soldieres to sailors and perhaps most importantly of all, to religious psychopaths. Soldiers formed societies worshiping mithrandese, other priests formed societiies thatworshiped the original wolf mother. These were the seedy under current of rome. For a city with over a million people was heavily socialised and people were eeager to both make and betray their friends. These groups had a lot of influennce on rome. A well placed guild of merchants could scheme to overturn laws, a group of priests could arrange a riot, a group of angry locals could become a powerful political force. 

  

But the guilds also had their positives. It was way for skilled and trained people to meet and trainthe next generation. Engineers, phiosophers, city planners, administrators and such all found  their way into the ranks oftheseguilds. It was a key part of society.

  

Now the army. Rome had an extensive army. The largest standing in comparison to population and economic strength ever. This cconsisted of legions of roughly 10 thousand each. The senate decided where the legions went. During theimperial era this was changed to 28 legions of 5.5 thousand each with an extra 150k troops in the auxxiliry armies and the navies. Each legion had a commander and a strict command structure. It was common for the elite of rome to either win a command or work their way up through the ranks of the army into prestigious ranks. The best of these would go on to become generals, a rare honour bestowedupon men who were given the right to command multiple legions. Generals were only given these commands in when rome was in dire need. Rome was used to  conquering smaller nations and tribes. Usually more than a few legions were never needed. Only  went fighting Parthia or Carthage would such commands be given. 

  

Roman Religion 

Filled with mysticism and tribal superstitions, but made to feel prestigious because its rome and theyre rich. They stole all of greece’s gods because at one point in time southern italy was colonised by the greeks. The greeks also had immense influence on the romans. Philosophy andhistory was found in ancient greece.t
