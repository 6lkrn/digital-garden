Unaccounted Ballistics
A seemingly unimportant group of bandits are digging out a base in the side of the mountain. Whilst the party sweep through the dungeon they discover that there is something more to the hide-out, and that it’s main purpose isn’t simply a secret base of operations. The records / environment shows that a gross amount of <rare metal> / <explosive ore> remains unaccounted for - the bandits are part of a much larger operation. By following a trail of some description left by the bandits the party can determine the true base of operations and shut it down before the ne’er-do-wells manage to make the most of their acquired ballistics.

2. Just your Standard Ghost Story

Out on the road the party stumbles across a path leading into the wilderness. This path isn’t on any [[Root/Worlds/Caermor/Locations/Chaia/Maps\|Maps]], the party have never heard of it’s existance before. Perhaps a bard has heard a whisper of it by some drunken man one night, but nothing more. Some ways down the path the party come across a very welcoming village, and in that village the townsfolk are quick to talk about a <Insert cool weapon/item here> that their resident [[Mage\|Mage]] come blacksmith is close to completing. According to them it’s something that’s really gonna be sought after by adventurers and the like for <insert unique reason here>. The thing appears to be nearly ready. The townsfolk are sure tomorrow morning is the morning that it’ll be done, and insist that whilst they would love to introduce the party to the blacksmith, he has to remain in his workshop underground as he applies the final touches. 

Morning comes in the village, and it’s as if 100 years have passed. The town folk are nowhere to be seen, and the houses are all very close to ruin. Few roofs remain visible, and some of the houses are almost entirely swallowed by nature. The party can now search for the entrance to the blacksmiths workshop and claim their prize. Obviously the journey from this point on is one lined with ghosts and ghouls, and other such spooks.
