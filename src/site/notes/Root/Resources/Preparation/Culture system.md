9. Religion (1d6)
To fit the Bronze to Classical Age feeling of my setting it's likely that each culture will have a religion that has some or all of the aspects listed below. So think of the result you roll as the aspect that is most prominent in the culture. Even the Monotheists (as they existed in Bronze Age societies) acknowledge the existence of other gods, just that theirs is the most powerful or uniquely favours them.

The sixth option: Philosophy, could be likened to early Western (Socrates, Plato, Aristotle) or Eastern (Zen, Daoism) traditions. Another inspiration could be Aztec Philosophy. Any philosophical tradition would likely still exist within a framework that acknowledges the existence of gods, spirits and such. Atheism or agnosticism is likely non-existent in this setting.
Animism
Totemism
Veneration of the Dead
Polytheism
Monotheism
Philosophy
