Kavar Demographic Survey

  
  

1. ### Family: We all have a family, be it by blood or by social bond. Our heritage can impact the way we see the world and ourselves. What is your family like, how did the way you were raised affect who you became?
    

(Complete this question for one free non-magical item worth up to 100 gp, to be associated with your family)

  
  
  

2. ### Home: We all come from somewhere. Home is where the heart is, a place that you feel connected to no matter where you may be. Where do you consider to be home? Is it where you grew up, a place you made for yourself, or somewhere from your favorite memories?  
    

(Complete this question for one free regional trait which makes some kind of sense with your home)

  
  
  

3. ### Education and training: Where did you get your skills and abilities?  Did you have a specific teacher or mentor? Did you apprentice or were you self taught? 
    

(Complete this question for a +1 trait bonus to one class skill granted by your class)

  
  
  

4. ### Why didn’t you listen to mom and become a banker? The life of adventure is not for everyone. For one reason or another, you haven’t chosen to settle down and work an ordinary job. Why did you end up on this path? Is there a non-adventuring job you considered, or one which you would like to take up some day? 
    

(Complete this for one free skill point to be spent on a relevant profession or craft skill)

  
  
  

5. ### What is best in life? What kind of lifestyle are you used to? We all have our preferred creature comforts. Some people are happy as long as they have a comfy chair and a warm fire, others demand the finer things in life. And some people seem happy with stale bread and a rock to sleep on. What do you need in order to be comfortable, and how much more do you aspire to? 
    

(Complete this question for up to 50gp worth of non-magical clothing items, including jewelry and similar accessories)

  
  
  

6. ### What principles do you believe in? What causes do you support? Not everything we care about is a personal goal or quest. We all have positions on certain issues and sympathies that lie with groups and causes. Maybe you won’t join up and fight their battles, but you’ll at least sign their petition whenever they ask. 
    

(Complete this question for a +1 trait bonus to diplomacy and knowledge checks regarding the cause of your choice)

  
  
  

7. ### Why did that guy deserve a punch in the face? People do all kinds of things that get under our skin. What do people do that drives you nuts? What bugs you more than anything else?
    

(Complete this question for either a +1 trait bonus to intimidate or a +1 bonus to will save against rage effects)

  
  
  

8. ### Religion: Divine powers are an accepted, observable part of life in Kavar. There are many gods to choose from, each with their own teachings and beliefs. Faith can give us hope and strength in dark times, and guidance through uncertainty. It can change the way we relate to the world, to each other, and even to ourselves. What religion, if any, do you follow? What is your opinion of the other gods? What do you think of religious people and institutions? 
    

(Complete this question for one of the following benefits: A +2 bonus to knowledge religion and it becomes a class skill for you. Or, either the deific obedience feat or godless healing feat, though it does not take effect until you meet the prerequisites. Or a +1 bonus to saves against positive or negative energy effects)

  
  
  

9. ### Magic: Magic is a fact of life in Kavar, but its availability varies wildly. Some places rarely see more than a passing initiate priest every few years, others are so steeped in enchantments that their whole society would crumble without it. It can affect social status in unique ways. Street urchins born with a gift can become the elite, commoners who study in their spare time may be accepted to learn the arts of the wizard from the academy. Some people just learn a few tricks (or use only what their race was gifted with) to make life easier. And some people have no magic whatsoever. How do you see magic, magic users, and people without magic? 
    

(Complete this question for your choice of the following benefits: A single magical or alchemical item worth no more than 250 gp, or up to three such items worth no more than 75 gp each. Or a 1/day 0-level spell-like ability. Or a +1 trait bonus to a save against a recognizably magical effect 1/day)

  
  
  

10. ### Morals: We all have our limits. Only the most insane of sociopaths won’t draw the moral line somewhere. What is your moral code? What line won’t you cross? 
    

(Complete this question for a +1 bonus to saves against compulsions to do things you would not normally do.)

  
  
  

11. ### What do you do outside of adventuring? What are your hobbies, interests, or favorite pastimes? What do you do when you have nothing else that needs doing? 
    

(Complete this question for an entertainment item such as a book, cards, a puzzle or a musical instrument, worth up to 25 gp)

  
  
  

12. ### What is your vice? We all have our weaknesses, be it food, sex, gambling, collecting or stupid arguments over nothing. Some things just draw us in, seemingly irresistible despite our better judgment. What do you have trouble saying no to? 
    

(Complete this question for a +1 trait bonus to appraise, bluff and diplomacy checks pertaining to your vice)

  
  
  

13. ### What don’t you want to do? Contrary to the saying, millions of people can be wrong. What is it that everyone else seems to like that you can’t stand. What activity can the group all agree to do that will make you say “have fun, I’ll be over here doing something that isn’t fucking unbearable” before walking away? 
    

(Complete this question for a +1 trait bonus to sense motive checks against people offering the thing you hate, or enchantment effects drawing you in with the thing you hate).

  
  
  

14. ### Who do you know? Everyone has connections. Family, friends, colleagues, lovers or ex’s, we all have attachments. Who is in your life that you care about? How do you know them and what is your relationship like? 
    

(Complete this question for one free social trait that matches your background)

  
  
  

15. ### Fuck that guy! Do you have any enemies or rivals? Are their factions you oppose, either on principle or because they have wronged you? Is there someone you want to be rid of, even if only because they are in your way? Is there a nation that you’d enjoy seeing get knocked down a peg? Who hates you, who do you hate, and why? 
    

(Complete this question for your choice of the following benefits: A +1 trait bonus to attacks against members of your chosen faction. Or a +1 trait bonus to intimidate and sense motive against members of your chosen faction. Or a +1 trait bonus to bluff and disguise to pose as a member of your chosen faction)

  
  
  

16. ### AHHHH! MAKE IT GO AWAY! What are your greatest fears? Everyone has fears. Some fears are primal and basic, others are complex, tied to our experiences and needs. Some trigger a primitive fight or flight instinct, while others cause your stomach to sink and fill you with dread. What are you afraid of? 
    

(Complete this question for your choice of the following benefits: A +10 bonus to your base speed for one round when moving away from the object of your fear 1/day. Or a +1 trait bonus against fear effects not relating to your listed fear. Or a +2 trait bonus to diplomacy or intimidate checks made to convince others to avoid the object of your fears.)

  
  
  

17. ### Who Are you? It’s a simple question but one which rarely has a simple answer. People define themselves in many ways, by names, associations, roles, professions, titles, passions or quirks. How do you see yourself? What kind of person do you see yourself as, and how does it compare to the person you aspire to be? How is the person you present yourself as different from the way you see yourself when being honest with yourself? 
    

(Complete this question for your choice of a free race feat, +2 to the save of your choice, or revisal: pick three skills, you can reroll one of these skills 1/day)

  
  
  

18. ### What do you want? Some want to see their people rise to power and glory. Others want to see an enemy’s head on a pike. Some want to make the world a better place, and others just want to be rich and famous. We all have things we strive for, and want things that we may or may not actually think we should get. What are your goals that you pursue, and what are your desires? 
    

(Complete this question for a free combat feat, metamagic feat, or proficiency)

  
  
  

19. ### What do you have to hide? We all hide things from the world. Secrets, regrets, shame. What aspect of yourself and your life do you try to keep hidden from others? What do you try to hide even from yourself?
    

(Complete this question for a free teamwork feat)

  
  
  

20. ### What is your favorite color? Answer this however you like, in as much detail as you like.
