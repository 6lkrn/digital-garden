# Ship Actions

## Combat

  

Broadside (3 action points) - Fire all cannons simultaneously from one side of the ship (need gunner)

  

Pinpoint fire (1 action point) - Fire fore and aft cannons simultaneously (need firearm proficiency). This action can be taken by individuals.

  

Ramming (1 action point) - Use all movement (minimum 2) to make a melee attack against a ship at your ship's bow. Make an attack check (1d20+ram rating) contested by the enemy ship's hull check (10+hull rating) (need ram).

  

Boarding Action (2 action points) - A ship may declare it is attempting to grapple an enemy vessel and engage in a boarding action. (Requires grappling hooks and both ships will be in a grappled state). 

  

Repair (1 action point) - Recover hit points according to your carpenters ability (need carpenter/carpenter tool proficiency)

  

Encourage (1 action point) -  A PC may attempt to command or cajole the crew into better performance. Make a Charisma check (DC 20 - Morale Level). For every 2 points over the DC, your ship gains advantage in all actions for one round (minimum 1, round down). This cannot be used during a Boarding Action.

  

## Movement

At the start of each combat, gain movement points = your speed.

  

Forward Movement (1 movement point) - Enter a new hex straight ahead.

  

Normal Turns ( (Spend MP equaling your Rudder Rating) for each hexside) - (Turn 1 hex either left or right)

  

Full Sails (all movement points) - Travel 2x speed in a straight line (no turning allowed)

  

Come About (½ Total movement point) - Spend half your move speed to turn around immediately.

  

Come to a New Heading - This is a movement option which allows a ship to turn more than 1 hexside. The ship can sacrifice its whole movement to turn as many hexes as it wishes. This requires a Pilot Check = 10+rudder rating. Ignore if the ship was at anchor before coming to a new heading. If you fail the check gain 1 level of Water.

  

Drop Anchor - Immediately drop to 0 speed. While stopped, gain advantage with cannon attacks and disadvantage with rudder checks. 

  

Weigh Anchor - Lose ½ speed (round down), lose anchored status

  

Cut and Run - Lose anchor immediately gain full speed

  

Reverse Movement - A ship may spend its entire MP stock to move 1 hex directly backward. This cannot be combined with Come to a New Heading or Evasive Movement. 

  

Damage

If your hull takes damage > your HP. You immediately begin sinking. Gain one level of water every round.

  

Critical Hits allow you to disable one part of your enemy’s ships parts. (Either defender's choice or Random).

Sails - A ship may not move without sails. 

Rudder - A ship may not turn without a Rudder. 

Broadside - A ship may not fire a Broadside in that direction. 

Chase guns - A ship may not fire Chase Guns.

Cargo - The ship loses Cargo equal to your broadside*10. 

Crew - The ship loses crew = your broadside*5. A ship with minimum crew may not take action, except to resist being boarded. In addition, any checks the ship must make are at a disadvantage.

Hull - The ship immediately gains 2 levels of water.

## Origin

A Ship has a specific design that lends it bonuses.

  

Heavy Ships

Large, square rigged ships with plenty of protection.

Your ship gains 2 HP and loses 1 Speed.

  

Marine Ship 

Ships crewed with the most dangerous marines in all of Wild Seas. Your Ship can house 20 additional Crew.

  

Gilded Ships

Beautiful ships that provide +2 extra morale for the crew.

  

Second Hand Ship

Ships that were “acquired” from certain sellers and modified. Gain a free Background. 

  

Insulated  Ships

Ships that are designed to be sailed in northern, icy waters and as such are hardy and strong.

Gain advantage when sailing in harsh weather. Lose 1 less crew from weather related disasters 

  

Cargo Ship

Cargo Ships are built for the long haul, wide and large hulls with more masts. They are merchant vessels designed for sailing to distant lands. 

Cargo Ships can carry +100 Cargo.

  

Raid Ships 

Longboats designed to travel light and leave room for loot. Gain advantage with grappling. Reduced skeleton crew by 10.

  

Exotic 

Your Ship was designed and built in foreign lands. An Exotic Ship always earns more gold when  it sells foreign and exotic goods.. 

  

Backgrounds 

Backgrounds grant Advantages to your Ship, but, more importantly, they inform you about your Ship’s epic and unique tale. These are the events in the Ship’s past that build a reputation, that contribute to the Crew’s pride, that turn your vessel from “just a boat” to “a Ship.” A Ship may only have a specific Background once.

## Achievements 

  

Beyond the Horizon - Your Ship has sailed to the far reaches of the world, and docked in the colorful and distant ports. You gain advantage in charisma checks when speaking about the cultures, customs and people of far-away lands. Whoever you are speaking to, they believe you. 

  

Icebreaker - Your Ship sailed the frozen waters of the north, something that only the bravest and most heroic sailors have managed before, and so has earned the honorable title of  “Icebreaker.” Your crew are hardy and well disciplined, they will follow you to the ends of the earth after all. Gain +3 Crew Morale.

  

Captured by Pirates - Your Ship was captured by pirates, “refurbished” and sold. Your ship is equipped with smuggling compartments used to hide valuable Cargo (or Crew). When you hide something in your smuggling compartments, it cannot be found unless the person looking knows exactly where to look (such as if they are a former crewmember, for example—word of mouth is not enough) or spend a reasonable amount of time searching.  You can hide a single Cargo in this way. This doesn’t give you the ability to transport additional Cargo, only to protect what you have. 

  

Heroic Captain - One of your Ship’s Captains had a stellar reputation across the seas. That reputation passes on to your Crew. When you encounter an NPC sailor, old sea dog, retired naval Captain or similar individual, you can gain a free favour and that NPC will look favorably upon your Ship and her Crew. 

  

Pirate Hunter - Your Ship was once used to hunt pirates. When your Crew fights against pirates, they gain +1 to hit and damage rolls. Pirates will not attack you unless in force.

  

Prominent Battle - Your Ship survived a horrible battle and has gained a reputation for being able to survive. Your Ship can ignore 1 Critical Hit per battle. 

  

Black Token - Your Ship has a small and strange mascot from strange lands. It could be a small monkey, parrot, runic totem, a custom wheel carved from a special wood or another kind of lucky charm. You can dispel a magical effect on your ship 1/week.

  

Blessed by Lady Luck - Once per day, one PC on the Ship can use the Ship’s Good Fortune to re-roll any number of dice in an ability check that they just made, so long as they are aboard the Ship. 

  

Swallowed by the Triangle - Your Ship has explored the far waters of the Mystic Triangle. For a time, your Ship was even thought to have been lost. You can ask the GM a yes or no question about a specific magic, artifact, npc, creature or event and he must answer you honestly. 

  

A Jenny in Every Port - Your Ship has made port in every Nation in the seas. When you make port, local authorities will recognise your Ship and her Crew, and will treat you relatively well until you give them a reason not to. 

  

A Short and Merry Life - Your ship is famous for crewing mercenaries and your crew knows that you will make them rich but that you don't expect them to be alive for too long. Gain +5 crew without being affected by your crew limit. 2x your crews pay. Your Crew gains +2 morale when paid and loses -2 morale for every day spent unpaid. 

  

Adventuring Spirit - Your ship and her crew are recognised as honourable heroes. Your crew are brave and well experienced. Gain extra fame every time you complete a daring adventure. 

  

Drag Them to Their Doom! -  Gain advantage when performing an boarding action. The first time each battle any of your Crew Squads kill an enemy while at sea, that enemy ship loses one additional crew. 

  

The dread pirate McDread - Defeating enemy ships while at sea gives you extra infamy. NPCs come to fear your ship and her crew and you gain advantage for intimidation checks against scared npcs. 

  

Gold Drives a Man to Dream - Having spent time learning the ins and outs of the trade ways you have gained recognition as a merchant . You may carry one additional Cargo on your Ship.

  

Blockade Runner - Experts in avoiding sticky situations, your Ship’s Crew has learned how to leave port in a hurry. Your Ship gains +1 speed and requires ½ the time to stock supplies and prepare to leave.

  

Marine Archeologist - Your crew are trained in diving and searching underwater phenomena such as a shipwreck, a reef or an underwater cave and are more likely to retrieve something valuable. Gain advantage in checks involving swimming, navigating underwater or holding your breath while on your ship. 

  

Off the Map - Having explored the very edges of the known world, your ship and crew have become experts at navigation. Reduce all travel time by 1 day and gain advantage with navigation checks.

  

Saved from the Deep - Having rescued some marooned NPCs (either lost at sea, on a deserted island, etc.) you gain permanent, completely loyal crew. Add +5 to your crew. 

  

Shore Leave - Encourage loyalty and trust amongst your crew by letting them explore the nearest seedy pub. You immediately recover all lost morale when docking at a popular port and your crew are more likely to come back. 

  

Tempting Fate - At any time, any PC can roll a d20. If <10, they gain disadvantage on all checks for the rest of the day. If >10 they gain advantage on all checks for the rest of the day. This roll cannot be taken while the last roll is still in effect.

  

Thanks for the Backup - Having saved another ship when things looked their bleakest (fierce storm, sea monster attack, etc), you gain a permanent ally. The Captain and Crew of that Ship  can be relied upon for friendly assistance when needed.

  

Well Excuse Me, Princess Transport - Having transported a member of royalty from one port to another, any NPC with noble blood treats you a little better. Gain +1 to any social checks involving noble characters.

Iron Hull Banding 1 - Strips of iron riveted to the hull to deflect incoming fire. 

  

Ram - A Ram is a beak of iron and wood attached under the bow of a ship to allow for greater damage when two ships collide. Better rams provide more damage.

  

Silken Sails 1 - An extremely expensive upgrade, this replaces the twill sails on a ship's mainmast with much tighterwoven silk, thus catching the wind more effectively. Gain +1 speed.

  

Swivel Guns - These small, quick-loading cannon are intended to attack the personnel on the deck of a ship just before a Boarding Action. Kill 5 crew every time you hit with a successful broadside.

  

Sweeps - additional small sails which hang from the sides of the ship, improving its speed at the expense of getting in the way during boarding actions and being extremely vulnerable to damage. Reduce turning by 1 MP.

  

Whaling Launch - a small, reinforced boat deliberately designed for hunting maritime creatures and a stock of harpoons and high-test line. This Quirk has the effect of providing an extra month's worth of supplies without using Cargo Slots, and each Cargo Slot devoted to food and supplies will provide four months stock instead of the normal three.

  

Fireproofing 

Price: Deck- 2,000 gp Hull – 2,000 gp Masts- 1,500 gp 

Characteristics: Makes surface considered “Nonflammable” for the sake of catching on fire- does not provide fire resistance 

Further Upgrades: May add fire resistance 

  

Figurehead - A decorative figurehead to show the might and beauty of your ship. Gain +1 Morale and people will be impressed by your ship. G

  

Cannon Ports - Adds port holes for 2 Light cannons facing forward or reverse. Increase width of Broadside by 1 tile.

Improved Rudder - +1 Rudder Rating.

 Further Upgrades: Fine-Tuned - +2 to pilot checks. Requires Improved Mechanism.
