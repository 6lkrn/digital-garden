Grave Robber’s Shovel: The shaft of this shovel is black and the blade a dark gray steel. The blade of the shovel glows when within 50 ft of an undead creature. This shovel deals 2d6 damage and has +1 to hit but only against the undead, the true owner is always considered proficient. This shovel can magically exhume a corpse without disturbing the grave or coffin. The shovel can do so once and regains the ability to do so at midnight.|
