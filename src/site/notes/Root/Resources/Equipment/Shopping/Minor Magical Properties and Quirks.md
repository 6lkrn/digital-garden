| 1       | **Beacon.** The bearer can use a bonus action to cause the item to shed bright light in a 10-foot radius and dim light for an additional 10 feet, or to extinguish the light.               | 11      | **Sentinel.** Choose a kind of creature that is an enemy of the item's creator. This item glows faintly when such creatures are within 120 feet of it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| 2       | **Compass.** The wielder can use an action to learn which way is north.                                                                                                                     | 12      | **Song Craft.** Whenever this item is struck or is used to strike a foe, its bearer hears a fragment of an ancient song.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 3       | **Conscientious.** When the bearer of this item contemplates or undertakes a malevolent act, the item enhances pangs of conscience.                                                         | 13      | **Strange Material.** The item was created from a material that is bizarre given its purpose. Its durability is unaffected.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 4       | **Delver.** While underground, the bearer of this item always knows the item's depth below the surface and the direction to the nearest staircase, ramp, or other path leading upward.      | 14      | **Temperate.** The bearer suffers no harm in temperatures as cold as -20 degrees Fahrenheit or as warm as 120 degrees Fahrenheit.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 5       | **Gleaming.** This item never gets dirty.                                                                                                                                                   | 15      | **Unbreakable.** The item can't be broken. Special means must be used to destroy it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 6       | **Guardian.** The item whispers warnings to its bearer, granting a +2 bonus to Initiative if the bearer isn't incapacitated.                                                                | 16      | **War Leader.** The bearer can use an action to cause their voice to carry clearly for up to 300 feet until the end of the bearer's next turn.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| 7       | **Harmonious.** Attuning to this item takes only 1 minute.                                                                                                                                  | 17      | **Waterborne.** This item floats on water and other liquids. Its bearer has advantage on Strength (Athletics) checks to swim.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 8       | **Hidden Message.** A message is hidden somewhere on the item. It might be visible only at a certain time of the year, under the light of one phase of the moon, or in a specific location. | 18      | **Wicked.** When the bearer is presented with an opportunity to act in a selfish or malevolent way, the item heightens the bearer's urge to do so.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 9       | **Key.** The item is used to unlock a container, chamber, vault, or other entryway.                                                                                                         | 19      | **Illusion.** The item is imbued with illusion magic, allowing its bearer to alter the item's appearance in minor ways. Such alterations don't change how the item is worn, carried, or wielded, and they have no effect on its other magical properties. For example, the wearer could make a red robe appear blue, or make a gold ring look like it's made of ivory. The item reverts to its true appearance when no one is carrying or wearing it. |
| 10      | **Language.** The bearer can speak and understand a language of the DM's choice while the item is one the bearer's person.                                                                  | 20      | Roll twice, rerolling any additional 20s.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

| **d20** | **Quirk**                                                                                                                                                                                           | **d20** | **Quirk**                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 1       | **Blissful.** While in possession of the item, the bearer feels fortunate and optimistic about what the future holds. Butterflies and other harmless creatures might frolic in the item's presence. | 7       | **Metamorphic.** The item periodically and randomly alters its appearance in slight ways. The bearer has no control over these minor alterations                                                                     |
| 2       | **Confident.** The item helps its bearer feel self-assured.                                                                                                                                         | 8       | **Muttering.** The item grumbles and mutters. A creature who listens carefully might learn something useful.                                                                                                         |
| 3       | **Covetous.** The item's bearer becomes obsessed with material wealth.                                                                                                                              | 9       | **Painful.** The bearer experiences a harmless flash of pain when using the item.                                                                                                                                    |
| 4       | **Frail.** The item crumbles, frays, chips, or cracks slightly when wielded, worn, or activated. This quirk has no effect on its properties, but if the item has seen much use, it looks decrepit.  | 10      | **Possessive.** The item demands attunement when first wielded or worn, and it doesn't allow its bearer to attune to other items. (Other items already attuned to the bearer remain so until their attunement ends.) |
| 5       | **Hungry.** This item's magical properties function only if fresh blood from a humanoid has been applied to it within the past 24 hours. It needs only a drop to activate.                          | 11      | **Repulsive.** The bearer feels a sense of distaste when in contact with the item, and continues to sense discomfort while bearing it.                                                                               |
| 6       | **Loud.** The item makes a loud noise - such as a clang, a shout, or a resonating gong - when used.                                                                                                 | 12      | **Slothful.** The bearer of this item feels slothful and lethargic. While attuned to the item, the bearer requires 10 hours to finish a long rest.                                                                   |
