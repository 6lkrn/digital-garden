[[Root/Resources/Equipment/Armour/Armour\|Armour]] ([[Shield\|shield]]), very rare (requires [[Attunement\|attunement]])Â 

While holding this [[Shield\|shield]], you can speak its command word as a bonus action to cause it to animate. The [[Shield\|shield]] leaps into the air and hovers in your space to protect you as if you were wielding it, leaving your hands free. The [[Shield\|shield]] remains animated for 1 minute, until you use a bonus action to end this effect, or until you are incapacitated or die, at which point the [[Shield\|shield]] falls to the ground or into your hand if you have one free.
