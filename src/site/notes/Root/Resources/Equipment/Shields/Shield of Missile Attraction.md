Armor ([[Shield\|shield]]), rare (requires [[Attunement\|attunement]])

While holding this [[Shield\|shield]], you have [[Resistance\|resistance]] to damage from ranged weapon attacks.

**Curse.** This [[Shield\|shield]] is cursed. Attuning to it curses you until you are targeted by the [[Campaign Resources/Magic/Spells/Remove Curse\|remove curse]] spell or similar magic. Removing the [[Shield\|shield]] fails to end the curse on you. Whenever a ranged weapon attack is made against a target within 10 feet of you, the curse causes you to become the target instead.
