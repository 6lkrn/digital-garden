Wondrous item, uncommon (requires [[Attunement\|attunement]]) 

While wearing this helm , you can use an action to cast the [[Detect Thoughts\|detect thoughts]] spell (save DC 13) from it. As long as you maintain concentration on the spell, you can use a bonus action to send a telepathic [[Message\|message]] to a creature you are focused on. 

It can reply-using a bonus action to do so- while your focus on it continues. While focusing on a creature with [[Detect Thoughts\|detect thoughts]], you can use an action to cast the [[Suggestion\|suggestion]] spell (save DC 13) from the helm on that creature. Once used, the suggestion property can't be used again until the next dawn.
