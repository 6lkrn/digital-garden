Once you don this cursed [[Root/Resources/Equipment/Armour/Armour\|armour]], you can't doff it unless you are targeted by the [[Campaign Resources/Magic/Spells/Remove Curse\|remove curse]] spell or similar magic. While wearing the [[Root/Resources/Equipment/Armour/Armour\|armour]], you have disadvantage on attack rolls against demons and on saving throws against their spells and special abilities.
