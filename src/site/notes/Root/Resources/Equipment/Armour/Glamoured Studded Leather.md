[[Root/Resources/Equipment/Armour/Armour\|Armour]] (studded leather), rareÂ 

While wearing this [[Root/Resources/Equipment/Armour/Armour\|armour]], you gain a +1 bonus to AC. You can also use a bonus action to speak the armour's command word and cause the armour to assume the appearance of a normal set of clothing or some other kind of armour. You decide what it looks like, including colour, style, and accessories, but the armour retains its normal bulk and weight. The illusory appearance last until you use this property again or remove the armour.
