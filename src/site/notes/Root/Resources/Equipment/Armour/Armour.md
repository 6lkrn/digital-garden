# **Armour and Shields:**

D&D worlds are a vast tapestry made up of many different cultures, each with its own technology level. For this reason, adventurers have access to a variety of armour types, ranging from leather armour to chain mail to costly plate armour, with several other kinds of armour in between. The Armour table collects the most commonly available types of armour found in the game and separates them into three categories: light armour, medium armour, and heavy armour. Many warriors supplement their armour with a shield.
 
The Armour table shows the cost, weight, and other properties of the common types of armour worn in the worlds of D&D.

# **Armour:**

**Properties** 

## **Armour Proficiency:**

Anyone can put on a suit of armour or strap a shield to an arm. Only those proficient in the armour’s use know how to wear it effectively, however. Your class gives you proficiency with certain types of armour. If you wear armour that you lack proficiency with, you have disadvantage on any ability check, saving throw, or attack roll that involves Strength or Dexterity, and you can’t cast spells.

## **Armour Class (AC):**
## **Heavy Armour:**

Heavier armour interferes with the wearer’s ability to move quickly, stealthily, and freely. If the Armour table shows “Str 13” or “Str 15” in the Strength column for an armour type, the armour reduces the wearer’s speed by 10 feet unless the wearer has a Strength score equal to or higher than the listed score. |

## **Stealth in Armour:**

If the Armour table shows “Disadvantage” in the Stealth column, the wearer has disadvantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks. |

## **Shields:**

A shield is made from wood or metal and is carried in one hand. Wielding a shield increases your Armour Class by 2. You can benefit from only one shield at a time. |

 

## **Getting Into and Out of Armour:**

The time it takes to don or doff armour depends on the armour’s category.

**Don.** This is the time it takes to put on armour. You benefit from the armour’s AC only if you take the full time to don the suit of armour.

**Doff.** This is the time it takes to take off armour. If you have help, reduce this time by half. Donning and Doffing Armour

## **Variant Rule (Equipment Sizes):**

In most campaigns, you can use or wear any equipment that you find on your adventures, within the bounds of common sense. For example, a burly half-orc won’t fit in a halfling’s leather armour, and a gnome would be swallowed up in a cloud giant’s elegant robe. 

The DM can impose more realism. For example, a suit of plate armour made for one human might not fit another one without significant alterations, and a guard’s uniform might be visibly ill-fitting when an adventurer tries to wear it as a disguise.

Using this variant, when adventurers find armour, clothing, and similar items that are made to be worn, they might need to visit an armour smith, tailor, leatherworker, or similar expert to make the item wearable. The cost for such work varies from 10 to 40 percent of the market price of the item. The DM can either roll 1d4 × 10 or determine the increase in cost based on the extent of the alterations required.
