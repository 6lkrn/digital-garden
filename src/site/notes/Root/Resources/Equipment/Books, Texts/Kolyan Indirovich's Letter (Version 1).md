(see [[Root/Worlds/Barovia/Locations/Svalich Woods\|Svalich Woods]] Introduction)


# **TEXT**

<table><tbody><tr class="odd"><td><p>Hail to thee of might and valor,</p><p> </p><p>I, a lonely servant of [[Root/Worlds/Barovia/Locations/Barovia\|Barovia]], send honor to thee. We plead for thy so desperately needed assistance.</p><p> </p><p>The love of my life, [[Root/Worlds/Barovia/NPCs/Ireena Kolyana\|Ireena Kolyana]], has been afflicted by an evil so deadly that even the good people of our village cannot protect her. She languishes from her wound, and I would have her saved from this menace.</p><p> </p><p>There is much wealth in this community. I offer all that might be had to thee and thy fellows if thou shalt but answer my desperate plea.</p><p> </p><p>Come quickly, for her time is at hand! All that I have shall be thine!</p><p>[[Root/Worlds/Barovia/NPCs/Kolyan Indirovich\|Kolyan Indirovich]]</p><p>Burgomaster</p></td></tr></tbody></table>
