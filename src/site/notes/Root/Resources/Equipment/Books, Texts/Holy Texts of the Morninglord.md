At the first dawn, the Morning lord rose and looked upon the world. Lonely and curious, he wrought from the land all life. Plants, animals and then finally humans. He made them in his image and taught them how to live amongst the world he had created. He toiled till the toiling was done and the world was filled with light and life and laughter. And then he rested and the first night was created. 

At the first night, the Night Mother took form. She looked at the dark and quiet land and went amongst it, she brought with her sleep, death and the end of all things. The people were enraptured, for they had never seen a force so opposite and yet so matching to that of the Morning Lord. 

And thus it continued, what the Lord would create, the Mother would destroy, back and forth. Neither able to exist when the other did and neither able to live without. 

And then a third took birth, the Dusk Bringer. He was the middle of both worlds, and with him he brought balance. A way for the people of the world to live in both light and darkness. 

A peace was forged. The moon was created and life went on. 

The Church of the [[Root/Worlds/Barovia/NPCs/Morninglord\|Morninglord]] was created soon after three champions were chosen. The Angel, The Dragon and the Lost One. The three traveled throughout the lands, meting out justice, punishment and rewards. They were the arms and the eyes of the Lord and their disciples were the holy men of the church. 

**-lots of parts torn out of the book-** 

Though two have fallen and the third remains lost, the church continues their holy duty of preaching, spreading and upholding the lessons of the [[Root/Worlds/Barovia/NPCs/Morninglord\|Morninglord]]. We hold on to the relics of the Champions, believing that one day they will return and once again **- the rest has been crossed out -** 

The holy relics are kept in churches throughout the land and in the fallen keep of the Knights. It is our solemn duty to protect and hide them.
