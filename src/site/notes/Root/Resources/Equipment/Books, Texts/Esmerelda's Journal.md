# Regarding Vampire Spawn

*Third Day of the Seventh Moon*
 
A newly made vampire will often not know what has happened to it. I say “it” for a very real purpose. For although a vampire spawn outwardly appears to be human, its soul is an unholy void driven by a grotesque hunger for blood.
 
Vampire spawn can only mimic with cold intellect what they once were in life. Inwardly tormented, they claw desperately to reclaim the time when they could feel their souls growing and flowering within them. So do not be lured into their pernicious masquerade of feelings and emotions—not until your vision is made sharp by your instincts and intention. When you realize that your very soul is at risk, you will find that the once-great labyrinth of false appearances and self-deception vanishes like a fish through unskilled fingers.
 
By the time you track down a spawn, any sense of its former life and identity will be gone. But spawn are cunning, and when one sees a novice hunter, it will act confused, sad, or frightened. By playing on your sympathies, it hopes to lure you closer to its fatal grasp. For this very reason, the first vampire that a novice faces is often the most dangerous. Only after much experience can vampire hunters rid themselves of instinctual hesitation.
 
Most vampire spawn lose their humanity like sand flowing inevitably through an hourglass. Some souls fall faster than others, embracing evil even before their first kills. The less fortunate creatures must fumble through several kills, trying to come to grips with their heinous nature before their souls are entirely consumed. Early in my career, and still terribly naive, I took in a vampire’s victim in hopes that I could cure him through an experimental decoction of wolfsbane, moonglove, yarrow, and twitchtail. I lashed him to a thick support beam in the cellar, then watched helplessly as his humanity slipped away. The terrible hunger quickly overtook him, like wolves on a dying elk. The wretch writhed and cried out as if poisoned, then suddenly stiffened like one impaled on a pike. His flesh blanched. His eyes turned dead like stones. Then a darkness filled those eyes, helping me to truly understand the vampire’s irredeemable nature.

 

 

# Dealing with the Devil

*Eleventh Day of the Seventh Moon*
 
Your best weapon against Strahd is not the stake or the silver blade, but your powers of objective perception—your internal awareness of what is fact and what is false.
 
Like any master predator, a vampire of the age and power of Strahd will attack that which is weakest in its prey. For creatures of any of the sentient races, our weakest points are our minds, which are easily clouded by manipulating our emotions and pandering to our darkest desires.
 
Strahd has lived for countless centuries, and he has tired of the kill. That is not what is most important to him now. He is interested solely in the corruption of souls. He envies purity, hating its innocence and freedom. No matter how sullied you believe yourself to be, your soul is a shining diamond of hope and clarity compared to his irredeemable darkness.
 
Strahd’s power lies in finding your weaknesses, then twisting them into warped realities. If you succumb to his power, he can make you see your friends as enemies, or turn a simple desire into hateful greed or murderous envy. He will seek out all your buried hatreds and fears, then gather them up to become the strings with which he directs you as his unwitting puppet.
 
How can you avoid this threat? How can you tell if Strahd’s charm has wormed its way into your mind?
All I can say is, “Be vigilant.”
Strahd will try to get your allegiance and turn you to his side. Your anger and pain are his tools. Your pride and arrogance are his weapons. It takes only a moment for Strahd to reweave the fabric of your mind with his threads of whispers and illusions. Should you feel yourself being taken over by his power, isolate yourself. Chain yourself in a cellar if needs be, and do not act upon the thoughts within your mind. For those thoughts will be the machinations of Strahd, and can cause only pain and interminable sorrow for you and those you love.

 

# Tools of The Trade

*Twenty-Fifth Day of the Seventh Moon*
 
Holy water is a potent distraction for vampires and their spawn. Because those creatures never unconsciously blink, their preternatural awareness is of a singular intensity much like a serpent’s. Throwing holy water at its eyes can make a vampire recoil, giving you a moment’s disruption in which to strike or flee.
 
A vampire might sometimes look distracted or seem as if it is lost in reverie. Know that this is a carefully rehearsed act meant to cause prey to relax, even for a moment. Underneath this act, the fiend can barely contain its lust for blood, and you can be sure that its full attention is locked in on the heat of your beating heart and the pulse of your veins.
 
When hunting vampires, look to fog and vegetation as an indication of their presence and power. Where the fog is thick and moving in irregular ways, you can be sure that an elder vampire is near. The thicker the fog, the older the vampire. As well, where vegetation is withered, look for the nest of a vampire spawn. These creatures will often use existing holes in the base of trees or between boulders to get deep into the ground without leaving traces of freshly dug earth. If the vegetation is blighted and twisted, this is instead the sign of an elder vampire nearby. As a rule, the more extreme the distortion of the natural order, the more powerful the vampire that causes it.
 
Shadows will also bend and warp in the presence of a vampire, and there again, the intensity of the effect increases with the power of the fiend. When the hair stands up on the back of your neck, you may take it as a sign that you are being stalked by the undead. With training and sensitivity, your body can become an instrument in sensing evil and unholy beings. I have found that when fighting the damned, instinct serves me better than my intellect. Research and knowledge have their place and are a vital part of hunting. But when you are faced with life and death, trust your gut and do not hesitate.
