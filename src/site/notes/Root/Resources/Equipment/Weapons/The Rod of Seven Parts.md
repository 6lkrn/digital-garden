The Rod of Seven Parts

You can either use the version from the Dungeon Masters Guild (<http://www.dmsguild.com/product/206383/>) or my personal version in Æthercoil Magazine Issue \#5

Either way, the starting locations can be chosen at random. Either by dice or by cards.

Use the encounter and map depicted in *Storm King's Thunder*, only replacing the lost giant relic with the part of the rod in place.

 

Eventually, if the party doesn't find all of the pieces, some NPCs might get their hands on them. This would create an ethical dilemma for those wishing to collect them all or keep the parts away from the wrong hands. Do they let the NPC keep the piece or take it from them?
