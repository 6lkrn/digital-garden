Wondrous item, very rare

You can speak the carpet's command word as an action to make the carpet hover and [[Fly\|fly]]. It moves according to your spoken directions, provided that you are within 30 feet of it. 

Four sizes of carpet of flying exist. The DM chooses the [[Campaign Resources/Rules/5e/Combat/Size\|size]] of a given carpet or determines it randomly.

<table><tbody><tr class="odd"><td><strong>D100</strong></td><td><strong>Size</strong></td><td><strong>Capacity</strong></td><td><strong>Flying Speed</strong></td></tr><tr class="even"><td>01- 20</td><td>3 ft. X 5 ft.</td><td>200 lb.</td><td>80 feet</td></tr><tr class="odd"><td>21-55</td><td>4ft. X 6ft.</td><td>400 lb.</td><td>60 feet</td></tr><tr class="even"><td>56- 80</td><td>5 ft . X 7 ft.</td><td>600 lb.</td><td>40 feet</td></tr><tr class="odd"><td>81-100</td><td>6ft. X 9ft.</td><td>800 lb.</td><td>30 feet</td></tr></tbody></table>

A carpet can carry up to twice the weight shown on the table, but it flies at half speed if it carries more than its normal capacity.
