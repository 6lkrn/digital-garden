Scroll, Special rarity.

This is a specialized version of a scroll of *[[Campaign Resources/Magic/Spells/Teleportation Circle\|Teleportation Circle]]*, that will open up a portal to a prepared circle in a town. This scroll only works within a certain distance, usually as far as the main dungeon in question, and is only one-way. This scroll is sold by a business with a regularly increasing price. It is designed as a "Egress of Last Resort" which is there for the party to make an emergency escape.
