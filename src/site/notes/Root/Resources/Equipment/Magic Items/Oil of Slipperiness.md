Potion, uncommon 

This sticky black unguent is thick and heavy in the container, but it flows quickly when poured. The oil can cover a Medium or smaller creature, along with the [[Root/Resources/Equipment/Shopping/Trade Goods\|equipment]] it's wearing and carrying (one additional vial is required for each [[Campaign Resources/Rules/5e/Combat/Size\|size]] category above Medium). Applying the oil takes 10 minutes. The affected creature then gains the effect of a [[Freedom of Movement\|freedom of movement]] spell for 8 hours. 

Alternatively, the oil can be poured on the ground as an action, where it covers a 10-foot square, duplicating the effect of the [[Grease\|grease]] spell in that area for 8 hours.
