Wondrous item, uncommon (requires [[Attunement\|attunement]])

While wearing this necklace, you can breathe normally in any environment, and you have advantage on saving throws made against harmful gases and vapours (such as [[Cloud Kill\|cloud kill]] and [[Stinking Cloud\|stinking cloud]] effects, inhaled [[Campaign Resources/Equipment/Items/Poisons\|poisons]], and the breath weapons of some dragons).
