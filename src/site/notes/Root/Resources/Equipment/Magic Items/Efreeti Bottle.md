**Efreeti Bottle**
Wondrous item, very rare

This painted brass bottle weighs 1 pound. When you use an action to remove the stopper, a cloud of thick smoke flows out of the bottle. At the end of your turn, the smoke disappears with a flash of harmless fire, and an efreeti appears in an unoccupied space within statistics.


The first time the bottle is opened, the DM rolls to determine what happens.

<table><tbody><tr class="odd"><td><strong>D100</strong></td><td><strong>Effect</strong></td></tr><tr class="even"><td>01-10</td><td>The efreeti attacks you. After fighting for 5 rounds, the efreeti disappears , and the bottle loses its magic.</td></tr><tr class="odd"><td>11-90</td><td>The efreeti serves you for 1 hour, doing as you command. Then the efreeti returns to the bottle, and a new stopper contains it. The stopper can't be removed for 24 hours . The next two times the bottle is opened , the same effect occurs. If the bottle is opened a fourth time , the efreeti escapes and disappears, and the bottle loses its magic.</td></tr><tr class="even"><td>91-00</td><td>The efreeti can cast the wish spell three times for you. It disappears when it grants the final wish or after 1 hour, and the bottle loses its magic.</td></tr></tbody></table>
