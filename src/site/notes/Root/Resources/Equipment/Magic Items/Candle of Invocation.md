Wondrous item, very rare (requires attunement)

This slender taper is dedicated to a deity and shares that deity's alignment. The candle's alignment can be detected with the [[Detect Evil and Good\|detect evil and good]] spell. The DM chooses the god and associated alignment or determines the alignment randomly.

<table><tbody><tr class="odd"><td><strong>D20</strong></td><td><strong>Alignment</strong></td></tr><tr class="even"><td>1-2</td><td>Chaotic Evil</td></tr><tr class="odd"><td>3-4</td><td>Chaotic Neutral</td></tr><tr class="even"><td>5-7</td><td>Chaotic Good</td></tr><tr class="odd"><td>8-9</td><td>Neutral Evil</td></tr><tr class="even"><td>10-11</td><td>Neutral</td></tr><tr class="odd"><td>12-13</td><td>Neutral Good</td></tr><tr class="even"><td>14-15</td><td>Lawful Evil</td></tr><tr class="odd"><td>16-17</td><td>Lawful Neutral</td></tr><tr class="even"><td>18-20</td><td>Lawful Good</td></tr></tbody></table>

The candle's magic is activated when the candle is lit, which requires an action. After burning for 4 hours, the candle is destroyed. You can snuff it out early for use at a later time. Deduct the time it burned in increments of 1 minute from the candle's total burn time.

While lit, the candle sheds dim light in a 30-foot radius. Any creature within that light whose alignment matches that of the candle makes attack rolls, saving throws, and ability checks with advantage. In addition, a cleric or druid in the light whose alignment matches the candle's can cast 1st-level spells he or she has prepared without expending spell slots, though the spell's effect is as if cast with a 1st-level slot.

Alternatively, when you light the candle for the first time, you can cast the gate spell with it. Doing so destroys the candle.
