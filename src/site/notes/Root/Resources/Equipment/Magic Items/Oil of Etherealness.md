Potion, rareÂ 

Beads of this cloudy gray oil form on the outside of its container and quickly evaporate. The oil can cover a Medium or smaller creature, along with the [[Root/Resources/Equipment/Shopping/Trade Goods\|equipment]] it's wearing and carrying (one additional vial is required for each size category above Medium). Applying the oil takes 10 minutes. The affected creature then gains the effect of the [[Etherealness\|etherealness]] spell for 1 hour.
