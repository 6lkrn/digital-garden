Potion, uncommonÂ 

When you drink this potion, you gain the "enlarge" effect of the enlarge/reduce spell for 1d4 hours (no concentration required). 

The red in the potion's liquid continuously expands from a tiny bead to colour the clear liquid around it and then contracts. 

Shaking the bottle fails to interrupt this process.
