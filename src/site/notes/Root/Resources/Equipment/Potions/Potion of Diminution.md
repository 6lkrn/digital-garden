Potion, rare 

When you drink this potion, you gain the "reduce" effect of the enlarge/reduce spell for 1d4 hours (no concentration required). 

The red in the potion's liquid continuously contracts to a tiny bead and then expands to color the clear liquid around it. 

Shaking the bottle fails to interrupt this process.
