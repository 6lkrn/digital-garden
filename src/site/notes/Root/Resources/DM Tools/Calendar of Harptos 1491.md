**Calendar of Harptos: 1491**

The people of the Forgotten Realms number the years by the Dalereckoning calendar, which is abbreviated “DR.” Years are also given names, which are drawn from the writings of a great seer from long ago.

**Note:** Every four years, another holiday called "Shieldmeet" is added as a leap day immediately following the Midsummer holiday.
