Trevuss, [Mother Gloam](Mother%20Gloam.md)'s son, is badly deformed, with a twisted and ugly face. Though he is intelligent and sly as his mother, his intellect is blighted and usntable. The townsfolk revile him and force him to live in a hovel on the outskirts of [[Caermor\|Caermor]]. It was his desire for revenge that lead to him pledging his loyalty to [[Tiamat\|Tiamat]]. Trevus is greatly paranoid, he believes that everyone hates him and is out to get him. He tries his best to avoid the party, but will fight to the death to protect [[Root/Worlds/Caermor/NPCs/Belle\|Belle]].
