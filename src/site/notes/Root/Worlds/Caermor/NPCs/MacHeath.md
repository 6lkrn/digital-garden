MacHeath is the owner of the village's only pub ([[Root/Worlds/Caermor/Locations/Chaia/The Standing Stones\|The Standing Stones]]).  He runs the pub with his wife [[Root/Worlds/Caermor/NPCs/Lara\|Lara]]. He is usually more closed-mouth than [[Root/Worlds/Caermor/NPCs/Derion\|Derion]]  because it suits his purposes — or, more correctly, [[Root/Worlds/Caermor/NPCs/Belle\|Belle]]'s purposes — to listen  more than talk (a bartender is rarely noticed listening to a conversation and often confided in by drunk customers). 

He acts friendly toward strangers, though, to gain their confidence or to got information. Few know more about the residents and the happenings of the village than MacHeath.

MacHeath is a member of the conspiracy led by [[Root/Worlds/Caermor/NPCs/Trevus\|Trevus]] that conjured the dragon now tormenting the town. The reasons for his involvement would seem a little obscure to his neighbours if they knew; he appears to have nothing to gain by the travail. Not so, in MacHeath's eyes. He has been working the pub, which was his father’s before him — but, even though he is an integral part of the community, his status in the open of the farmers is fairly low because he does not work the land.

MacHeath could bear this faint scorn if he were rich — unlike most other villagers, he has a dwarfs acquisitive nature — but he makes precious little from the pub. [Mother Gloam](Mother%20Gloam.md) has convinced him that the dragons will right the wrongs he perceives. Not only will the dragon lay low those who hold him in ill repute, but he will also share in all booty that is collected as a result of the dragon's rampages.

Even though he is a member of the conspiracy and acts as [[Root/Worlds/Caermor/NPCs/Belle\|Belle]]'s foster father, MacHeath is unaware of the child’ true identity. He is not capable of examining this issue rationally since [[Root/Worlds/Caermor/NPCs/Belle\|Belle]] has charmed him.
