Is a strong and powerful man with dark, intense eyes. Incredibly worn out with greying hair, he has the look of a broken man. Though he has lost the will to do anything, pride will motivate him to act. Doesn't care about his kingdom, leaves his sons and lords to their own devices. Collects rare and valuable items for his museum. Tall and domineering man that was broken by the death of his first wife. After ascending to the throne due to his mothers favour, he defeated his brother in a horrifying war that devastated the nation. To finish the war and solidify the kingdom he entered into a political marriage with Fayeh, though he was not happy. Shortly after this as more and more nobles appeared at his court, he met Zaia, his true love. A whilrwind romance leads to her pregnancy and a secret marriage. Unfortunately she died in childbirth.
