Belle Fagor: Belle appears to be a [[Human\|Human]] female child, age 10, of neutral alignment (actually the influence of a psionic power, aura alteration). This cute blonde child (note that her hair colour  makes her stand out from the locals who are dark- or red-haired) is actually Baalphegor, Princess of Hell. To enliven a short stretch of eternity, she visited [[Caermor\|Caermor]] in the form of an orphaned child (her parents, she claims, were killed by brigands on the road) to stir up trouble after [[Root/Worlds/Caermor/NPCs/Trevus\|Trevus]]’s request for a devil became known in the Hells. At the present time, she lives with [[Root/Worlds/Caermor/NPCs/MacHeath\|MacHeath]], the pub owner.

Belle found [Trevus](Trevus.md) tailor-made for her plans. Working her way into his sympathies and playing on his [[Campaign Resources/Rules/One Piece 5e/DM Screen/General Rules/Adventuring/Madness\|Campaign Resources/Rules/One Piece 5e/DM Screen/General Rules/Adventuring/Madness]], she became the only person he likes and trusts, and uses him to control the operations of the coven. For now, she plans to let the coven think that it is in charge of things; the cruel truth will be delivered later. Desiring a break from the [[Infernal\|Infernal]] politics of the Nine Hells, Baalphegor is enjoying herself and regards her interplanar tinkering as a sort of game, with its own rules. 

The purpose of this “game” is to test the mettle of the coven, seeing whether it is determined and wicked enough to be of further use in the future. As part of this test, Belle has ensured that the
summoned devil is properly limited in its power (see description of the devil below) and understands that Belle, not the coven, is the real ruler in the area. Though she uses her influence over [[Root/Worlds/Caermor/NPCs/Trevus\|Trevus]] to protect the devil in the abandoned church and to keep the “fun” going, she does nothing directly, since that would be against the “rules” by which she plays her game. If the devil is
killed and the coven is still relatively intact, she reveals herself to the coven and orders the conspirators into conflict with the party. If the coven and the devil are both defeated, she abandons the project and visits the adventurers in her childlike form, thanking them for the entertainment they have provided her. Then she transforms into her true devilish shape and vanishes, but not before darkly promising that she intends to have more “fun” with the party in the future, since it seems to think it's good at fighting devils.

Whenever Belle is encountered, she is standing off to the side, possibly in a shadowed doorway, watching the characters with an intense gaze. As soon as some character notices her, she leaves.
In conversation, Belle is quiet but gives the feeling of wisdom beyond her age.

Belle's game is to watch people combatting the devil and the coven, not to obliterate them. If any character attempts to physically attack Belle, she teleports away instantly or uses her powers to prevent injury to herself without inflicting damage on her attackers. If the attack is continued with any degree of determination and chance of success, however, she reveals her true nature and returns the attack with all her might.

Baalphegor is a cinnamon-brown female, apparently [[Human\|Human]] but for her red eyes, forked tail, and slender, leathery wings. One of the Nine Hells’ most artful and beautiful she-devils, Baalphegor is an honoured diplomat and a consort to [[Root/Worlds/Caermor/NPCs/Mephistopheles\|Mephistopheles]], and counts [[Root/Worlds/Faerun/NPCs/Asmodeus\|Asmodeus]] as a close ally.

Young in looks, Baalphegor is magically skilled and can use the following spell-like powers, one at a time and once per round: [[Campaign Resources/Magic/Spells/Pyrotechnics\|Campaign Resources/Magic/Spells/Pyrotechnics]], [[Campaign Resources/Magic/Spells/Produce Flame\|Campaign Resources/Magic/Spells/Produce Flame]], [[Campaign Resources/Magic/Spells/Animate Dead\|Campaign Resources/Magic/Spells/Animate Dead]], [[Campaign Resources/Magic/Spells/Dispel Magic\|Campaign Resources/Magic/Spells/Dispel Magic]], charm
person, [[Suggestion\|Suggestion]], detect [[Campaign Resources/Magic/Spells/Invisibility\|Campaign Resources/Magic/Spells/Invisibility]],  enchant an item, permanency, [[Teleport\|Teleport]] and (fulfill another's) limited [[Campaign Resources/Magic/Spells/Wish\|Campaign Resources/Magic/Spells/Wish]]. Once per day, she can employ a [[Finger of Death\|Finger of Death]], unleash [[Chain Lightning\|Chain Lightning]], and [[Heal\|Heal]] herself. She causes [[Fear\|Fear]] (2 range) by pointing at the victim (save vs. spells at -2); she can summon 1-2 devils with a 75% chance of success. Baalphegor regenerates 1 hp damage every four
rounds.

Though extremely powerful, Baalphegor was not included in order to crush the player characters. She should be played with care and cleverness, befitting her extreme intelligence.
