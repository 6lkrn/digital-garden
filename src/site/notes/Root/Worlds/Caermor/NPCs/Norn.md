Norn is the village's tradesman; he collects the wool and other goods the village sells, strikes the deals with traveling merchants, then divides the revenue. In keeping with this responsibility, Norn is very hard-nosed, particularly with strangers. When it comes to money, he is extremely tight, never letting the right hand know what the left is doing.

Because of his hard ways, strangers might assume that Norn is disliked by the villagers. Nothing could be further from the truth. Norn is liked and respected by all in [[Caermor\|Caermor]], and in return, he is exceedingly fair with all local people. With strangers, however, he's still honest in his dealings, but will take them for all they are worth in a trading situation.
