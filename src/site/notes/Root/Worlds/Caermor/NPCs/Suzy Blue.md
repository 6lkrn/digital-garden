[[Root/Campaigns/As DM/7. The Prince of Thieves/7. The Prince of Thieves\|7. The Prince of Thieves]]
Suzy is reckless, adventurous, and tomboyish. She does not like to be kept away from action and will often bend or break the rules in order to find some. She is a ragamuffin but a great friend and very loyal.

Informant for [[Root/Worlds/Caermor/NPCs/Draen Kanaan\|Draen Kanaan]]
