As local minstrel, what Dougal lacks in size (he is barely 5'6") he more than makes up for in arrogance and swagger. He dresses in finer garb than most, favouring garish green tunics and cloaks.
  
Dougal's main character trait is conceit. Flattery is always met with sweeping good humour; anything that could be  taken as a personal slight is met with anger and, if severe enough, drawn steel. Speaking with Dougal is one of life's more aggravating pursuits. The only thing that has kept the locals from putting an abrupt end to his career is the fact that he truly has talent: he can sing, play, and tell tales extremely well, even though he has never received bardic training.

Dougal is the final member of the conspiracy, and even though he will never admit it outright, his conversation is often sprinkled with comments that show he expects great things out of life in the very near future, starting with [Gwendolyn](Gwendolyn.md) as his personal slave.
