Tremayne and Verlayne are identical twin brothers, friends and henchmen of [[Root/Worlds/Caermor/NPCs/Lane\|Lane]]. A year or so ago, he saved them and [[Root/Worlds/Caermor/NPCs/Martha\|Martha]] from a run in with some orcs, and from that day forward, they threw in their lot with him. He equipped them and is in the process of training them, but they are hardly fighters yet; when trouble arises, they tend to be rather slow to respond. Both are similar to [[Root/Worlds/Caermor/NPCs/Lane\|Lane]], open and friendly though maybe a little less na√Øve, despite their fewer years. 

Their loyalty to [[Root/Worlds/Caermor/NPCs/Lane\|Lane]] is outweighed only by their protectiveness of [[Root/Worlds/Caermor/NPCs/Martha\|Martha]]. Nothing brings them closer to being warlike than seeing someone bothering [[Root/Worlds/Caermor/NPCs/Martha\|Martha]].
