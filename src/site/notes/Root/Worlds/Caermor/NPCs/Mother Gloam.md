Mother Gloam is a vibrant old woman with cold, black eyes and a crow's nest of black hair. She dresses in voluminous, silk, dress with clashing colours. Smooth-tongued and intelligent, she is quick to tell fortunes using her tarot cards, with which she has a natural skill. However, what she sees in the cards and what she tells often differ, as she is as devious as she is intelligent.
Mother Gloam is, like her son [Trevus](Trevus.md), one of the leaders of the cult that summoned a dragon to [[Caermor\|Caermor]].  She depended on sacrifice and prayer to [[Tiamat\|Tiamat]] in order to help bring out the return of the dragons.  She uses a ring of disguise when snooping around or visiting the dragon temple.
