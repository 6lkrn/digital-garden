Description: She wears bulky tan painted plate armor, and she perpetually has her warhammer ready. Her hair is always cut to a buzz. Her skin is flawless and her amber eyes scan people very quickly.

Personality: Her voice, at times compared to that of a Nymph, lambasts those who consider themselves "civilized" with snide, belittling remarks; the subtle growl she speaks with growing louder in doing so, one can find it most pronounced, despite the otherwise natural purity of her tone. She has a cruel streak; something she gained from her previous mentor. She harbors resentment against her former mentor.

History: Sold as a small child to a necromancer, Oda was an assistant, and all too frequently test subject. She eventually earned her freedom when her former master disappeared. Since her father passed away years ago, her mother had doted on her, and she came to think her herself as special and better than other people in town. A notion that was reinforced by her attractiveness, a trait in which she easily excels the other women of her town.

Motivation: Wants to raise her children well; and she's repulsed by the pc
