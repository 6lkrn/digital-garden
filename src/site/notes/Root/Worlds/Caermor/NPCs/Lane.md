Lane and his small band are among those who have come to try to rid [[Caermor\|Caermor]] of its tribulations, They heard of the occurrences while in [[Root/Worlds/Caermor/Locations/Chaia/Sta Far\|Sta Far]], from a merchant who had stopped in at the village to trade for wool. Because of [[Root/Worlds/Caermor/NPCs/Lane\|Lane]]'s noble nature, he decided he and his party should do what they could to save the village. He and his friends arrived in [Caermor](Caermor.md) three days before the characters put in an appearance and immediately discovered that the village did not want to be saved. Finding themselves unwelcome in the village, they set up camp outside and began their investigations from there.

So far, they have discovered nothing. [[Root/Worlds/Caermor/NPCs/Lane\|Lane]] does not know of the existence of [Belle](Belle.md) and has not yet met [Lara](Lara.md), and thus knows nothing of her suspicions.  He has come to the conclusion that [Albee](Albee.md) is not guilty, merely on the evidence of the dead sheep he has found but can put forward no other theory. If asked, [[Root/Worlds/Caermor/NPCs/Lane\|Lane]] refuses to join forces with the characters on the grounds that two groups working independently have a better chance of succeeding hero than one large group. He does suggest exchanging information, however; anything one group finds out should be communicated to the other group. 

The DM can arrange for [Lara](Lara.md) to meet [[Root/Worlds/Caermor/NPCs/Lane\|Lane]] if the group fails to meet her first. [[Root/Worlds/Caermor/NPCs/Lane\|Lane]] is by no means stupid, but he is sometimes naïve in his belief that people are basically honest until proven otherwise. This open trust sometimes gets him into trouble. For himself, he holds chivalry and proper action above all else. Lane and his followers may be guided about the adventure as the DM desires. They will rarely interfere with the characters’ plans, but they might turn up in some unexpected places.
