Saturday wears a sorcerous cloak made of starshine and moonshade. She also wears a dress of spun gold studded with small sapphires. Her hair is long and electric blue, and she wears a sorcerous gold circlet on her brow, which has spells written on it in shifting silver. She uses a shade of blue on her lips.She is a powerful sorcerer. She was a bitter and envious woman, who hated Zaia and wants her sons to be the next kings.
Fayeh's spell casting focus is a quill. It can be used to write spells into the air allowing her to cast spells without needing to speak.
