AC 10, HP 25
Str 17,Int 10, Wis 9,Dex 12, Con 16, Cha 12; 
**Alignment.** Neutral
**Equipment.** Pitchfork, (if encountered outside town; treat as trident), short sword, dagger, crude drawing of [[Root/Worlds/Caermor/NPCs/Gwendolyn\|Gwendolyn]] (showing her beauty), 15 gp, 20 sp, 25 cp, and a skin of whiskey
**Age.** 50

Derion, [Gwendolyn](Gwendolyn.md)'s father, is the quintessential [Caermor](Caermor.md) man: stocky, strong, red hair and beard, and fierce when provoked or drunk. Since [[Root/Worlds/Caermor/NPCs/Gwendolyn\|Gwendolyn]]'s disappearance, he has become more sullen and has been “taking to his whiskey” quite seriously. He usually stays drunk every waking hour so as not to feel the pain over the loss of his daughter; when encountered, there is a 90% chance that he is drunk, but only to the point of severe surliness. He never attacks anyone without provocation; however, if [[Root/Worlds/Caermor/NPCs/Mother Gloam\|Mother Gloam]] has had
a chance to influence him, he will be looking for such provocation. Derion is not stupid and won't take on a large armed group. Rather, he tries to call out a single member for personal combat.

Since [[Root/Worlds/Caermor/NPCs/Gwendolyn\|Gwendolyn]]’s disappearance, Derion, normally a conscientious  farmer, has let his farm chores slip, and his land shows his preoccupation. From time to time he makes a cursory attempt to get things back to normal, but most of his time is spent in the pub or walking. Derion is a widower and has no other children.
