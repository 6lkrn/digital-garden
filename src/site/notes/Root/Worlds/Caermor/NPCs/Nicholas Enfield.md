Description: Runty and weak-looking, he likes to wear darkened spectacles and heavy clothing, no matter the weather. His hair, while still mostly auburn, has prominent grey streaks. He has a tattooed face.

Personality: His voice, at times compared to that of a Nymph, lambasts those who consider themselves "civilized" with snide, belittling remarks; the subtle growl he speaks with growing louder in doing so, one can find it most pronounced, despite the otherwise natural purity of his tone. His home and work are filled with various knick knacks he has acquired through the years. He cares a great deal for his adopted teenage son.

History: Nicholas was born the youngest of three triplets. He always admired arcane-users and wanted to develop the talent, but never had the affinity for it. Unlike his family, who was content to work in a sleepy main town, he wanted to work in the city. He has been working here for the past few years.

Motivation: He wants random interesting trinkets and junk, hates to throw anything away; and his relatives are trying to arrange a marriage

Occupation: Masseuse

Voice: Ums and uhs a lot
