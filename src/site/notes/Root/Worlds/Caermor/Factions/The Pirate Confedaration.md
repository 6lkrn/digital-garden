The pirate confederation 
A great floating city of wooden platforms and boats that the pirates live on.
Giant sails are used to move the city around if needed, but mostly are not used. 
When new ships sail in, they moor themselves to the city, temporarily making it larger.
During raiding seasons (winter) many pirates depart, leaving the city visibly smaller. 
Many merchants are permanently moored to the city, operating as pubs, shops and theaters for the pirates entertainment and needs.
City is ruled by a democracy, each pirate gets an equal vote, several “Captain-Generals” have emerged from the ranks to act as leaders for the many factions of the city.
