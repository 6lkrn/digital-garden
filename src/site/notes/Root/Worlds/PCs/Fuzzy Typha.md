Mitsu's Char for [[Root/Campaigns/As DM/6. Depths of Villainy/6. Depths of Villainy\|6. Depths of Villainy]]

**Fuzzy Typha hails from a clan of Tabaxi that made its settlement upon a lake’s shore, the Mirror’s Lake Clan. The lake perfectly reflects the surroundings on a clear sunny day giving it its name.

Her name comes from the surroundings like your typical Tabaxi. The first part of it is from her long fuzzy fur that looks unkept while the second part is from the cattails that line the lake’s shore. Her mother had once heard from travelers that some scholars call cattails Typha and decided to name her second child that.

Family:

Mother : Star Strike (Star)

Father : Floating Leaf (Leaf)

Older sister : Slick Reed (Reed)

Younger brother : Silken Bulrush (Bulrush)

She learnt the basic skills of a ranger from the older ones in her parent’s Hunt.

Driven by the curiosity of the Tabaxi race, Typha journeys away from her homeland in search of some new and interesting secrets. On her travels through the wilderness, she overheard some adventurers speaking of a disease that was ravaging the Misty Nucleation Forest in the mountains. The trees in the area were reported to be mineralized into various metals and slowly rusting away.

Upon reaching the diseased forest, Typha got to work researching the mysterious disease turning trees into mineralized versions of themselves from inside out. Often exchanging the forest’s bounty for knowledge and wisdom of the various [[races\|races]] that journey past or nearby the Misty Nucleation Forest.

The source of the infection was found to be an infestation of Rust [[Monsters\|Monsters]] which have gained a special ability to poison a tree’s phloem, causing the sap flowing through to slowly impart mineralization effects to the infected tree. The [[monsters\|monsters]] would then corrode the now mineralized trees as a new source of food.

However, the infestation was too much for one single Tabaxi to handle and after learning the secrets of the mineralizing forest, Typha decided it was no longer interesting and quite possibly dangerous to be in a Rust Monster infested forest. As she prepares to flee the forest, she saw a most curious ship sailing on the horizon into a seaside village below the mountains. As she sees the strange and unfamiliar ship, her curiosity peaked again, and she decided to visit the ship when it docks.

As Typha fled the forest, a few dryads approached, sensing the infected forest on the edge of their sphere of influence slowly deteriorating. Typha quickly told them the source of the infection as she could sense their hostility quickly increasing towards her. Grateful that the Tabaxi wasn’t the cause of the mineralization of the forest, and thankful for her knowledge, the dryads gifted her a glowing fruit that mysteriously materialized on one of the dryads’ branches prompting her to eat it.

The night after the encounter with the group of dryads, Typha ate the fruit that she was given and took a rest for the night. “What a weird thing to eat” she thought to herself, having had a carnivorous diet up till the mysterious fruit. She awoke the next morning faintly smelling of lavender, a rather helpful gift for masking her natural scent. It would seem the fruit had given her a feywild gift and given her the Fey Wanderer subclass.

As Typha walked into the seaside village that contained the port, she could see that the ship that attracted her attention had dropped anchor and was now stationary. On her deck, she could see that there appears to be an [[Aarakocra\|Aarakocra]] with a falcon on its shoulder. “How peculiar”, Typha thought as she walked towards the most curious ship. “Hey, you up there, are you the captain of this ship? Fancy a Tabaxi as a crewmate?” Typha shouted, hoping to catch the attention of the [[Aarakocra\|Aarakocra]].

Wants   : An adventure, anything that piques her curiosity

Needs : [something something, need but don’t want]

Fears : Rust [[Monsters\|Monsters]], after her close encounter with abnormal Rust [[Monsters\|Monsters]] in the Misty Nucleation Forest, she still fears them wondering what would have happened in the event that she was not able to escape the mineralizing forest.**
