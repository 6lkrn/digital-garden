[[Root/Campaigns/Players/Crys\|Crys]]'s Char for [[Root/Campaigns/As Player/5. Godless - Zen/5. Godless - Zen\|5. Godless - Zen]]
# Orpheus “Dualscar” Altenyaath

#### Backstory

- Like his ancestors who came before him, Orpheus acts as the bodyguard of the clan’s matriarch, Condensyn. As tradition would have it, he becomes a champion of Gl’bgolyb, from whom the matriarch is descended.
    
- The matriarch had an odd obsession with surface-dwellers: using the powers she inherited from the Emissary of the Deep, she capsized sailing vessels under the guise of “halting unlawful pirate activities”.
    
- One of the ships she capsized held a very interesting specimen: an [[elf\|elf]] with golden tan skin, bright as a midday sun. Vicious as one, too: he fought back when she grabbed him, to the point where Orpheus had to interfere, knocking the [[elf\|elf]] out with a solid bonk to the head.
    
- Condensyn kept the [[elf\|elf]] as a sort of glorified housepet. Using her [[Magic\|Magic]], she granted him the ability to breathe underwater, provided he stayed within her view. She never bothered to learn his name, and he wasn’t keen on giving it.
    
- Orpheus, on the other hand, was intrigued-- dwelling so deep under the sea, he seldom saw creatures so vibrant. Creatures who were as luminous were often dangerous and unapproachable. The [[elf\|elf]] was…… he wasn’t dangerous, at least not in comparison to the warlock, but he certainly did not want to be approached.
    
- At first, the [[elf\|elf]] was downright cold, borderline violent towards Orpheus. However, the warlock isn’t easily deterred-- he pesters the [[elf\|elf]], day in and day out. Even if the knife-ear doesn’t respond, he’ll just sit there and talk about his day and what he’s seen.
    
- As time goes on, it becomes clear that Orpheus was the only one who was even the slightest bit interested in the [[elf\|elf]]: the local triton didn’t want anything to do with him, and the matriarch gave him the minimum amount of care. Desperate for some attention -- any attention -- the [[elf\|elf]] caves in and entertains Orpheus.
    
- Orpheus learns many things through the [[elf\|elf]]-- he learns that the [[elf\|elf]] is an eladrin, a type of [[elf\|elf]] connected to seasons; he learns that the ship Condensyn capsized--of which he was the helmsman--belonged to the fleet of the [[drow\|drow]] Pirate Queen Marquess Spinneret Mindfang; he learnt that the reason he was on the seas in the first place was to search for a dear friend of his, a surprisingly mild-mannered [[half-orc\|half-orc]] by the name Kanrk Reiless. Yet even then, he still learns not the [[elf\|elf]]’s name. 
    
- As time goes on, the eladrin’s vibrant tan skin and golden hair starts to fade, giving way to a mellower palette of white and blue. Even his eyes, once a brilliant bright red, fades into a melancholic pale blue. No one knows why this is happening, and he doesn’t seem keen to disclose it with anyone.
    
- Anyone but Orpheus. At this point, their relationship has progressed beyond just acquaintances and friends, and entered the realm of romance. Though he isn’t overly bothered by the change, he still asks the [[elf\|elf]] directly about it after being pressured by Condensyn to do so.
    
- The eladrin tells him that if something has a big enough emotional impact on his kind, they can change from one season to another. He spills his guts to Orpheus about just how miserable he feels: he’s so far away from his friends and family, from all the things he knows and loves; not to mention he was snatched down to the depths unwillingly. He longs to feel the warmth of the sun on his skin again, to just…… see the surface.
    
- For a while after that, Orpheus is a bit torn-- on one hand, he doesn’t like seeing his lover suffer, and wants to help him escape; on the other hand, he is sworn to the service of the matriarch, and does not wish to go against her.
    
- In the end, he decided that his lover is worth more than his matriarch, whom he realized doesn’t see him as much but a meatshield anyways. They began planning their escape.
    
- When the time came for them to elope, Orpheus stole a Cap of [[Campaign Resources/Rules/One Piece 5e/DM Screen/Lists_Tables/Spellcasting/W-Z/Water Breathing\|Water Breathing]] from the clan’s coffers, so the eladrin won’t drown on their journey upwards. In the dead of (underwater) night, the two snuck out towards freedom.
    
- The matriarch discovered their disappearances, and rushed after them. She caught up to them just as they were about to breach the surface.
    
- A battle ensued between Condensyn and Orpheus. It ended with a pair of scars across his face, and an eladrin stuck on her trident.
    
- The [[elf\|elf]] called out to Orpheus to swim away, to not let himself get killed too. As his legs paddled for dear life, he heard his lover call out with his dying breath-- a name echoed through the water: Psiion.
    
- The shame from both betraying his own clan and failing to protect his lover were too much; so much so that he couldn’t bear to use his name anymore, going by the moniker “Dualscar” instead.
    
- Now an exile, Dualscar is unable to return to his clan. Through the Dark Lakes, he arrives in the [[Root/Worlds/Faerun/Locations/Underdark\|Underdark]]. He explores its unending caverns, hoping to find solace and nurse his grief, perhaps even find out who his secretive lover truly was. 
    
- Wait, the Reiless guy-- he was a close friend of his, right? Surely he’d know more about him? With that in mind, he resolves to search for the half-[[orc\|orc]]’s closest confidante: an elven matriarch by the name Dolorosa Veravara.
    

  

# Gl’bgolyb

Gl’bgolyb is a Lovecraftian horror living deep under the sea. No one knows where She came from-- most tritons believe Her to be just one of many ungodly beings dreamed into life by the kuo-toa. However, the Altennya--the clan assigned to guard the chasm where She resides--believe Gl’bgolyb to be a gift from their creator-god Persana: She lends them Her powers (either in the form of descendants like Condensyn or champions like Orpheus), and acts as a reminder of the triton’s place as guardians of the sea.

  

Legend has it that the bravest warriors of the Altennya swam into Her domain to bargain with her. They returned with powers and a child: Gl’bgolyb has agreed to remain docile, so long as they vow to feed and protect Her and this child-- Her child. Thus began the tradition of warlock bodyguards accompanying Gl’bgolyb-descended clan leaders.

  

While the powers She has from being tied to The Fathomless is a concern, the most dangerous thing about Her is Her voice: if She were to raise it higher than a whisper, it would release a psychic wave strong enough to kill all the nearby creatures. The higher it goes, the stronger it gets and the wider it reaches, the more things die.

  

Gl’bgolyb appears as a white tentacular mass with many squid eyes and beaks on both its front and rear. Other names that She is known by include “Speaker of the Vast Glub” and “Emissary of the Deep”.

##### Her Deal with Dualscar

When he first arrived in the [[Root/Worlds/Faerun/Locations/Underdark\|Underdark]], Dualscar immediately felt his warlock powers wane-- having violated his pact with Her, She was retracting Her powers from him. Thankfully, he was able to find and contact Her in his dreams, and they came to a new agreement: he will become Her eyes and ears on the surface, letting Her vicariously live life above water through him. In addition to that, She’ll contact him every once in a while, to hear tales of his adventures straight from his lips.

#### Notes:

- Psiion called out his full name to Orpheus -- Psiion Arundlin -- but because he was swimming away he could only catch his first name :(
    
- This happened when Orpheus was 107, four years ago; he’s now 111.
