[[Root/Campaigns/Players/Niki\|Niki]]'s Char for [[Root/_Ongoing Campaign/26. Curse of Strahd 2/26. Curse of Strahd 2\|26. Curse of Strahd 2]]

Name: Naagin 

Race: Serpentfolk 

Age: 30? (still deciding)

Background 
Naagin was born to two adventurers who settled in the city of [tbd]. She is one of twelve siblings. 
Her parents opened a family restaurant named Garlic Clove. All the dishes served at the restaurant feature a very special ingredient. Garlic.  Naagin learned how to cook from a young age. She worked at the family restaurant, alongside her parents and her brother (Naag). Naagin’s specialty is cooking with meat. 
The ten other siblings moved out to pursue their own things. Naagin doesn’t really know of their whereabouts. The others rarely stay in contact.  
One day, Naagin and her brother (Naag), went out to forage for some herbs. They came back to find their parents missing and Garlic Clove torn down. After making some inquiries, Naagin learned that Strahd was responsible for the destruction. It is unclear what his motivations were – Naagin thinks he just really hates garlic. 
Anyway, Naagin and Naag just fend for themselves now. They could only afford to set up a little street cart. Naagin continues to cook and sell her garlic meat dishes.
