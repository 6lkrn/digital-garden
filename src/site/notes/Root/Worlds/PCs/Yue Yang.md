[[Root/Campaigns/Players/Mitsu\|Mitsu]]'s Char [[8. Midtown Misfits\|8. Midtown Misfits]]

The Yang family is a tailoring family that recently moved into the Atilles Islands to run away from the rising civil unrest in their country. The grandfather has unfortunately passed in a scuffle before they left the country. 

The father mainly maintains the storefront and carved wooden hair pins orders while the mother and grandmother does the tailoring and embroidery.  

Yue is very interested in all things relating to tailoring and cloth. She takes time to study them so she can help in her family store when needed. She takes great pride in her sewing abilities**
