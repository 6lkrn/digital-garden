[[Root/Campaigns/Players/Crys\|Crys]]'s character for [[Root/Campaigns/As Player/6. Space Explorers - Zen/6. Space Explorers - Zen\|6. Space Explorers - Zen]]

in general lovienne's . relationship meter w/ everyone is p high cuz he just rlly likes ppl like that

but also depends. if ur an ass he might not like u

well "not like" u is wrong hed like u but less than everyone else

unless youre a very specific kind of ass then he might like u nore

  

What Lovienne thinks of The Crew:tm::

  

Felicity: Cute! So shy. Reminds him of himself when he was younger. Treats like his kid or something.

4CK U: So robotic (haha). That annoys him sometimes but most of the time he thinks they're adorable. Pinch cheek. Probably sees them as like.... a kuudere or some shit.

Shifan: Fluffy wabbit!!! Kinda jittery at times? Wonders what that's about. Reminds him a bit of his fiancé. -9999 points. Gets offset by the fact that Shifan is a cuddly widdle bunbun. +9999 points.

Vlad: Very.... tegap? Very 帅？I don't know what the English equivalent is. Cool, I think. Reminds him of his late husband at work. Would've netted Vlad extra like points if it weren't for the fact that it also makes him kinda sad. Net zero gain.

  

Note: Lovienne's starting relationship bar is pretty high, so he likes everyone and is friendly with them. It's just that some has more points that others. List is in order of highest to lowest, but TBH Vlad and Shifan are kinda tied at the bottom LOL
