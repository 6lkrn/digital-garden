# Tank McTankerdaughter

- Tank named after her birth place - a tank. See, her parents were soldiers fighting the war, there wasn't a best time and place to deliver a baby but her mother was a strong warrior who had to be at the war. 
    
- At the age of 18, Tank left her village in desperation to explore the world. 
    
- Her family of proud barbarians knew that she was ready to face the world, after all she trained to fight everyday.
