Ezira had always known that this thing, this relationship between her and Liam will end badly. It was not due to her being a Slayer or him being a vampire, it was due to Liam's jealous Sire.

Liam had complained to Ezira enough times and she as a Slayer also knew enough about vampires in general, vampires weren't loving creatures or even creatures with emotions that were on the more gentle spectrum. Vampires feel passion but they are all the extreme ends of passion. 

It was only a matter of time before Ezira met her demise because of the Sire's jealousy but she would never have thought she would be done in by a street urchin, of all people.

At least let her die in a fight, dammit.

When Ezira next opened her eyes, it was due to the glaring and hot sun shining down on her. She had thought for sure she would bleed to death slowly in the alley that few frequent in the dead of night and definitely not end up in a grassland somewhere.

Blinking a little bit more before sitting up, Ezira surveyed her surroundings. There were rolling hills in the distance but for the most part, it was just flat grassland with a farm warehouse in the near distance. Might as well head there and see if people are living there.

Ezira took her time to walk to her destination. She looked around idly. The air was clean and fresh, you could smell the verdant scent of it all, unlike the smell of smog in London. Surprisingly, her body doesn't feel all that different from back in London compared to wherever she teleported now. It was a nice change of scenery at least.

When the farm warehouse was in sight, Ezira jogged her way to what she hoped will be people and salvation. She circled around the building to look for people. When she saw a cottage a little on the side, she approached cautiously and knocked on the door firmly.

It took a while for someone to answer the door. Ezira was about to open her mouth to enquire when the occupant of the house interrupted her first.

"Oh dearie, what are you wearing in this weather?" The kindly-looking grandma exclaimed.

Ezira looked down at her outfit. It was a black long-sleeved knee-length dress, she did not wear the more restrictive corsets when she went out at night to patrol but her outfit was hardly scandalous.

"Um, this is what I usually wear, ma'am."

"It's hot out here, sweetie. Come in, come in." The kindly grandma ushered Ezira into the house.

"What's your name, sweetheart?" The lady asked as she puttered around the kitchen.

"You can call me Izzy, ma'am." Ezira looked around the interior, it was a cozy and homey space. There were framed pictures here and there, some doilies on the table or the bannister. There was also a piano on one side of a wall. It was a very lived-in house.

"How did you end up here, darling? Not many people come around here unless they're here for farmers' crops."

"Uh, I don't know how I ended up here, honestly. I just woke up on the grassland not far from here."

"Oh dearie, did you come from the rifts?" The kindly grandma's eyes widened at Ezira.

"What rifts are you talking about?"

The grandmotherly-looking woman explains the rifts to Ezira. It gives her a headache to understand that this is unfortunately not heaven but rather a different universe altogether. Can’t even die and be done with life, gosh.

“Why don’t you stay here with us? It doesn’t seem like you have a place to go to,” the lady looked on sympathetically.

Ezira was a little taken aback at the offer. “I couldn’t possibly intrude on your life like this. I can find my own way out there.”

“Dearie, you don’t have food on you and only the clothes on your back. You won’t make it out there in this new era,” the lady said sagely.

Ezira doesn’t say that she fights vampires on a nightly basis in her own world, surviving in a different world that works similarly to her own world was hardly impossible.

Ezira hesitated a little bit but ultimately said, “If you’re sure, then it would be my pleasure to stay here with you. But I do insist that you let me work here if you want me to stay here.”

The lady smiled at that response. “That’s what I like to hear from you young ‘uns these days.”

Ezira would be lying if she said she didn’t feel dread pool in her belly at that moment.

Despite Ezira’s low-grade caution about her predicament, nothing too out of the ordinary happened. She’s thankful she has a roof on her head and clothes for her to wear and she tires herself out by working around the farm.

For the first few days, Emma and her husband, George, show Ezira the ropes about pretty much all the minutiae of the inner workings of a farm. Ezira was no stranger to physical labour but only working on the farm and then going to bed early to wake up early and repeating the same thing the next day did become a little monotonous. 

Besides getting free housing and food and clothes, Ezira ended up accepting an allowance from Emma. Not to say she didn’t refuse adamantly, the money just always ended up on her bedside table in an envelope every Monday night without fail. She puts the money away as savings, it is the only funds she has in this world.

Ezira should have lowered her [[Guard\|Guard]] at some point after staying with the Gallaghers for close to a month, she was thankful she did not. 

Sleeping early does not equate to actually falling asleep. In her previous life (it might as well be a past incarnation), she sleeps in the early hours of dawn and then woke up only 2 or 3 hours later to go about her day. 

Staying in this cottage house that creaks and yawns with every breeze, it took a few days for her to get used to the natural sounds surrounding her to release herself from the conscious world. And in those early days when she pretended to sleep as she lay in bed hoping Somnus would take her soon, she hears things.

Ezira’s hearing isn’t as sharp as a vampire’s but she still hears conversations not meant for her ears when everything around them is quiet. 

Topics that involved her:

“I can’t believe you invited a stranger to stay with us.”

“Oh, come now. She’s wonderful. And helpful. She does more work than most of those boys we hire.”

“I’m not saying she doesn’t have a good work ethic but she’s definitely more alert than most people.”

“Well…”

“No.”

“She’s going to fit right in with the work we have under wraps. She seems the type to know how to keep a secret.”

“. . . We’ll see.”

Ezira doesn’t try to pry into whatever Emma and George have in this house. She works in the barn, she uses the kitchen, the bathroom and her own bedroom. That’s about it. She remembers her previous life when she married a duke who was running an underground business, her sole purpose of marrying the duke was to investigate the business but it seems the duke knew of her ploy but didn’t say anything and also kept a blind eye to her other nightly business in cemeteries. She wasn’t going to repeat doing undercover business that doesn’t gain her anything (in this life at least).

The choice was taken out of her hands when one early morning as Ezira was getting ready to start the day, eating her breakfast with the Gallaghers, Emma clears her throat pointedly. Ezira looks up at the two of them.

“Miss Izzy, I’m sure you’re at least slightly aware that we don’t just run a normal farm here.” George starts frankly.

Ezira swallows her mouthful of food. “I tried my best not to pry even if some of your hired boys could be a little more discreet with things.”

Emma giggled at that while George glared at his wife.

“We would like to invite you to learn the ropes of our operations. Mind, this is not a spur-of-the-moment decision. You’ve stayed with us for half a year now. We have sent a request to our higher-ups for permission to invite you to our operations. The permission was granted a week ago.

“You have a good head on you, and you are one of our most hardworking around so we would like you to join us in our endeavours.”

Ezira sipped at her coffee. “This is not like some [[Assassin\|Assassin]] stuff, right?” She’s only half-joking. The things that the ‘hired boys’ mishandled were mostly crates of herbs or supplies that Ezira helped to bring to the desired destination on occasion. 

“Well, assassination isn’t in our wheelhouse but we do sometimes supply poisonous herbs to them,” Emma said nonchalantly.

“I’ll work under probation first, I guess. I’m still doing regular farm work, right?”

And as the people say, that was that.
