[[Root/Campaigns/Players/Tauhu\|Tauhu]]'s char for [[Root/_Ongoing Campaign/20. One Piece/20. One Piece\|20. One Piece]]
## Backstory 

1. Caladrius Simurg is the only child of the Simurg family. The Simurg comes from the people of Sarkany, a deer-dragon humanoid hybrid. They live long lives, maturing slowly and having small numbers of progenies. When the Sarkany dies, they turn into trees and continue growing. The descendants would then care for this tree, allowing it to grow further. For the Sarkany, true death comes if they die as a tree. As such, Caladrius surrounds himself with plant caring knowledge and cares for nature.
    
2. Home is the Island of Ağaç, (Agk) used to be wild and free, with a stable and diverse ecosystem. In the middle of the island is the Grove, where the tree Sarkany are at. It’s Caladrius’ favourite place in the island, where he’d commune with his elders, whether to be asking for guidance or just…chilling.
    
3. His plant caring knowledge comes from a Jati, a living plant that lives symbiotically with the Sarkany in the island of Ağaç.
    
4. He is an adventurer at the moment as he escaped the island that’s currently under the Navy’s control. He’s looking for a way to regain control of his island and kick the Navy out. Should the Navy not come, he’d be a herbalist/botanist and leader of his people.
    
5. A nice life is one where one can frolic in the woods, commune with their deceased, and be at peace watching the sky, surrounded by family.
    
6. Caladrius believes in maintaining balance in the natural world. He believes in plant rights, especially those that can’t communicate with the majority.
    
7. People who abuse nature would drive him nuts. Though he would prefer to settle things diplomatically, *that* would get under his skin.
    
8. The pair deities Mehtap and Güneş (yunes) is believed to be their creator, though, Mehtap in particular was said to have created the Sarkany as a symbol of his love for his wife. It is said that when the world was created, Güneş first scattered plant life on it. But she soon found out that her trees can’t grow as big as she wanted. Seeing his wife unhappy, Mehtap decided to give part of him to the trees so they could grow big. He wanted them to be able to fend for themselves and that is why they were born as deer-dragon humanoids in the first part of their lives.  
    So, in their humanoid part of their lives, they would pray to Mehtap and in their tree part of their lives, they would pray to Güneş.
    

Caladrius doesn’t mind the belief of other deities. 

9. The harming of plant life for no reason or with disrespect.
    
10. Caladrius likes to read out books to plants, or to anyone that would listen.
    
11. He can’t help but *stare* at things that interest him.
    
12. He hates loud music and rowdy dancing. So annoying. So high pitched. So headache inducing.
    
13. The ones he cares the most are his people, his great-grandpa and his Jati mentor Ahihia. Being a member of the island that cares for plants, he is highly regarded. Ahihia accepted him as his apprentice for his hard work,determination and extreme care for plant life.
    
14. Obviously, the Navy. They came to the island, demanded the wood of the tree Sarkany for their ships, burned the island when they were refused, captured the people, treating them like lifestocks and culled them systematically to provide a new source of wood. Adding insult to the injury, they pretended that if Caladrius took an eye out, the sarkany would be spared. NOPE.
    
15. FIRE. SPECIFICALLY HUGE ASS FIRE.
    
16. A conservationist and a leader trying to get his people their rights returned.
    
17. Caladrius would very much like to see the Navy fall and restore his island.
    
18. He…actually enjoys meat and violence.
    
19. On his person are his sling bag, filled with implements to record plants he encounters, a silver rapier, and a big book of folklore. He had long white hair, covering his right eye. He has antlers, one broken. He wears a wide brim rattan hat and wears a half, wooden plated armour that covers his chest. You can see his tail and long ears, with his clawed, slender fingers and claws feet.
    
20. Caladrius uses his rapier for close combat, but prefers to stay at the back and cast magic most times due to his blindness in one eye. If possible, he would rather not kill or start a fight in the first place. He’s focused on being quick and nimble. If he’s stopped in his tracks though…
    
21. The world needs balance - in the form of natural balance. Not the 50-50 thing. Though nature would rebalance itself no problem, going through it would be *hell* for beings with consciousness. So, he would like it if people can understand that imbalance should *not* be let go out of hand.
    
22. He met the team when he escaped from the island and floated on a raft. The ship saw him and let him onboard. He’s the ship’s provision manager.
    
23. Captain’s motivation is to kill the Navy. Heck yeah.
    
24. Favourite colour is Raw Umber - it’s under orange-brown. A natural pigment!
