[[Root/Campaigns/Players/Harman\|Harman]] - My name is [[Root/Worlds/PCs/Combust\|Combust]] i am artificer scientist, i am a specialist in gun powder and cannons i own a shitty boat that i travel with an ungrateful crew that look for the easiest way to earn a buck rather than the smartest way. i feel as though this crew is keeping me back from experiencing the treasures of the world its wonders and people and culture.
