## BACKSTORY

[[Mary Fier 1\|Mary Fier 1]] was born in Stanley of East Atilles Island, and has never escaped the region for her whole life. Her parents are not exactly the most responsible type, but they still managed to provide a simple roof over their heads, by working at the largest and only laboratory in the district. While Mary’s father, [Peter Fier](Peter%20Fier.md), is believed to be in the leading position of his expertise in the lab, he spent most of his earnings on his own personal science equipment for his own research, which are known to be extremely expensive. Too obsessed with his own study in his room full of weird electronic devices, he rarely spent time with the family, resulting in Mary being extremely rebellious against him.  

Mary’s mother, [[Root/Worlds/Other worlds/NPCs/Felicia Fier\|Felicia Fier]] on the other hand, is just a laborer in the same workplace as her husband. Mary would only see her mother during morning and night, where the mother would prepare simple meals for her daughter, and she would be off to work for the rest of the day, including the weekend. Mary was also sent to the local school by her parents so that the school would look after her when the parents are not home.
  

As a kid, Mary does not care or understand why the adults are always busy doing their things and not be able to have fun. Earthbound to the lands without much company from her parents, she grew up to be doing whatever she loves without much restrictions, being mischievous and disobedient so that at least she was unbound by the rules. Since the parents do not really care about her, she ended up not giving a crap about how others think about her. She also developed a desire to get out of this boring town, and travel beyond the rivers and oceans just to see what is really lying out there.
