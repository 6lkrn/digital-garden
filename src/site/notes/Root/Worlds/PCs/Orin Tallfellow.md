Orin grew up in the impoverished slums of Firglo to a happy but desperate family. His parents ran a small cobbling business, scrounging for scraps to serve as materials in their works. The family had migrated to city after their underground enclave had been destroyed. The strange culture and their darker appearance did nothing to befriend the humans and other races of the city. Outcasted into the slums, they did their best to survive. Unfortunately, Orin’s father fell into alcoholism and gambling to cope with his new reality. They were hard workers but mounting debts and desperation forced them to sell their business, their house and eventually their youngest children for money.

He was bought by a shadowy and secretive society known only as “[[Root/Worlds/Kathor/Factions/The Syndicate\|The Syndicate]]”. This organisation hunts down young talented beings to train into super secret and powerful weapons. Orin happened to be scouted for this exact purpose due to his natural magical ability. He was raised in a halfling commune within the city by [[Root/Worlds/Other worlds/NPCs/Vonbi Tallfellow\|Vonbi Tallfellow]]. Vonbi’s real daughter was being held hostage by the syndicate. He was ordered to raise Orin according to directions from The Syndicate. He trained Orin in magic, giving him books to read and other lessons to make him loyal to [[Root/Worlds/Kathor/Factions/The Syndicate\|The Syndicate]]. As he grew up. Orin fell in love with a halfling girl from his neighbourhood named [Blossom Wiseacre](Blossom%20Wiseacre.md). Training under Vonbi as a bard, the bright and lovely girl was the Yin to the dark and thoughtful Orin’s Yang. Their romance was secret and sweet. Over time Vonbi too came to love Orin as his own son. Orin was finally happy and safe. 

After years spent training and blending in, Orin was ready. His mission? The assassination of a Halfling politician that refused to cooperate with [[Root/Worlds/Kathor/Factions/The Syndicate\|The Syndicate]]. What Orin did not know was that he had been set up to take the fall for the murder. He was meant to serve as mere cannon fodder. Factions within the syndicate disagreed on the murder of the politician and some of them planned to frame Orin as a rogue agent after the act had taken place. Vonbi soon caught wind of this from his dealings with Syndicate agents and he hatched a plan to save his adopted son. 

As soon as the politician was dead, everyone made their move. The faction sent an assassin of their own to kill Orin and make sure he told noone about his orders. Vonbi, Orin and [[Blossom\|Blossom]] prepared to make a trap for the assassin and run away. Unfortunately for them, they were no match for [[Root/Worlds/Kathor/Factions/The Syndicate\|The Syndicate]]. Orin came back to see his life and house burning and Vonbi and [[Blossom\|Blossom]] missing. He vowed to spend the rest of his life looking for them and to kill the assassin that ruined his life.
