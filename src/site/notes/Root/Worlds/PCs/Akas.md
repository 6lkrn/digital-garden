# Akas Tynan

Akas remembered little about his childhood. Any time he wanted to recall about it by himself, all that he remembered was misty and obscure, a blur green and a faint smell of flowers at best. He looks pretty much like a human but he has cat ears, tail, claws and fangs. He wasn’t too sure if he was a Tabaxi, a human or...whatever. What he knows is he is what he is.

What he is sure of is that he has a family here in the Feygarden - a family that has bestowed a name, cared for him and allowed him to thrive.

The mother and father that he knew was a pair of Alseids by the name of Alyssum and Yarrow respectively. What they told him about his childhood was that he came to them as a gift. And that he should not worry about it. The two would often frolic around with satyrs and dryads alike, living a carefree and tranquil life. They had other children too, but as far as Akas knew, these foster siblings of his were all scattered around either Feygardens or the Material Plane. Alyssum and Yarrow did tell him about them, Alseids or half Alseids themselves. Truth be told though, he couldn’t really remember all of them, especially when they’re all names without faces.

The Alseid grove where Alyssum and Yarrow were a part of, in an extension knew and welcomed him. Even the satyrs and dryads that come for the frivolities opened their arms for him, especially to their gatherings after he was of age. Young Akas learnt music and socialisation from the gatherings. He soon found himself a close friend and a frequent lover in the form of a dryad named Zinnia.

The circle had a favourite pastime – hanging out at the Material Plane via a pocket. It was risky, but such is a fey’s nature. The group had numerous excursions, partying hard at the Material Plane and going back to the Feygarden and vice versa, sometimes whisking away whatever humanoids that stumbled upon them. Unfortunately for Akas, on one of these excursions he failed to return in time before the pocket disappeared.

He was trapped. Or rather, he was locked out.

With no proper knowledge or power to make a portal back home, Akas waited around the area, hoping that the pocket may pop up again. He waited for a few weeks, hunting for food, drinking water from the stream and seeking shelter at abandoned burrows or encampment.

Perhaps out of chance or fate, the place he waited at was soon taken over by a pack of bandits. Having little combat knowledge and experience, but being lucky enough, Akas escaped within an inch of his life. He managed to drag himself as far as possible from the bandits before he fainted from his injuries.

Although he was sure he would die, Akas instead woke up in a giant’s home.

The Stone giant introduced himself to a frightened, hurt and confused Akas. A gentle giant, Tarvos explained how he found the young fey at the verge of death and took him in. He was pitied and was rather intrigued with the fey and when he found out that Akas was attacked by bandits, he was disturbed by it.

Tarvos himself lives alone and wants to keep peace. But he is not one to just let someone be defenceless. So he offered Akas swordplay and runic knowledge to be able to defend himself, should he ever wish to leave...or to take revenge.

Grateful for the giant’s assistance and kindness, Akas learnt as much as he could and tried his best to repay Tarvos’ aid. The giant humoured the young fey, but soon and slowly urged Akas to forget this ‘debt’. They did foster a good relationship, though, with the giant telling Akas about his own childhood and such.

The young fey soon missed his home again, missed his parents Alyssum and Yarrow, Zinnia and the people in it. He also wanted to seek more information about his own childhood memories. Perhaps even finding out people like himself.

He bid goodbye to Tarvos and made his way into the world. A simple young fey, with simple wants, going into the unknown. A simple young fey, who learned that even in the material plane, the more names he has, the easier he could slip by.
