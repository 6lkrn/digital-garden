[[Root/Campaigns/Players/Balky\|Balky]]'s character for [[Root/Worlds/PCs/Vladimir Pe\|Vladimir Pe]]
##### Vladimir

A no-nonsense soldier. He keeps his head down and his ship functional and well defended. Tall and muscle bound Vlad has an imposing figure that warns others to keep their distance. Does not take risks and fights fearlessly. Has a heavy russian accent. Often seen with his headphones on when he mans the turrets. Has proper academy training in the fields of combat and piloting. 

  

View of Others: 

- Felicity - Hard worker, not the best worker. Very nervous.
    
- Lovienne - Harmless. Unnecessarily attached to the crew. Provides a strategic benefit in negotiations and social encounters.
    
- 4CK U - Multiple personalities make 4ck u unpredictable and therefore a possible risk. Keeps notes on any issues that may send the robot berserk. 
    
- Naheer - Scientist.
    
- Shifan - Absolute security risk. His role in combat should be minimised due to his addictive personality.
