|# TECH CASTING|INFO|NOTE|
|WARP STRIKE (0)|Alignment: None<br><br>Casting Time: 1 action<br><br>Range: Varies<br><br>Duration: 1 round|As part of the action used to cast this power, you must make a melee weapon attack against one creature within your reach, otherwise the power fails. On a hit, the target suffers the attack’s normal effects, and you can teleport to an unoccupied space of your choice within 10 feet of you. If you teleport to a space within 5 feet of the target, the target cannot take reactions until the end of its next turn.<br><br>  <br><br>This power’s damage increases when you reach higher levels. At 5th level, the melee attack deals an extra 1d6 energy damage to the target. This extra energy damage increases to 2d6 at 11th level and 3d6 at 17th level.|
|TEMPORARY BOOST (0)|Alignment: None<br><br>Casting Time: 1 action<br><br>Range: Touch<br><br>Duration: up to 1 minute (Concentration)|You touch one willing creature. Once before the power ends, the target can roll a d4 and add the number rolled to one ability check of its choice. It can roll the die before or after making the ability check. The power then ends.<br><br>  <br><br>This power’s die increases at higher levels: to a d6 at 5th level, a d8 at 11th level, and a d10 at 17th level.|
|TARGET LOCK (1)|Alignment: None<br><br>Casting Time: 1 bonus action<br><br>Range: 90 feet<br><br>Duration: up to 1 hour (Concentration)|You choose a creature you can see within range and mark it as your quarry. Until the power ends, you deal an extra 1d6 damage to the target whenever you hit it with a weapon attack, the target gains no benefit from one-quarter, half, and three-quarters cover against you, and if the target is invisible, you can see it as if it were visible. If the target drops to 0 hit points before this power ends, you can use a bonus action on a subsequent turn of yours to mark a new creature.<br><br>  <br><br>Overcharge Tech. When you cast this power using a tech slot of 3rd or 4th level, you can maintain your concentration on the power for up to 8 hours. When you use a tech slot of 5th level or higher, you can maintain your concentration on the power for up to 24 hours.|
|KOLTO PACK (1)|Alignment: None<br><br>Casting Time: 1 bonus action<br><br>Range: 60 feet<br><br>Duration: Instantaneous|A creature of your choice that you can see within range regains hit points equal to 1d4 + your techcasting ability modifier. This power has no effect on droids or constructs.<br><br>  <br><br>Overcharge Tech. When you cast this power using a tech slot of 2nd level or higher, the healing increases by 1d4 for each slot level above 1st.|
|ADRENALINE (1)|Alignment: None<br><br>Casting Time: 1 reaction, when a creature within range that you can see would roll initiative<br><br>Range: 30 feet<br><br>Duration: Instantaneous|You infuse one creature within range with a jittery burst of power, speeding its senses and reactions to the point of near precognition. The creature makes its initiative check with advantage.|
|AID DROID (1)|Alignment: None<br><br>Casting Time: 1 bonus action<br><br>Range: 60 feet<br><br>Duration: Instantaneous|Choose one droid or construct that you can see within range. The target can immediately use its reaction to regain hit points equal to 1d6 + your techcasting ability modifier.<br><br>  <br><br>Overcharge Tech. When you cast this power using a tech slot of 2nd level or higher, the healing increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 1st.|
|TRANSLOCATE (2)|Alignment: None<br><br>Casting Time: 1 bonus action<br><br>Range: Self<br><br>Duration: Instantaneous|Your form shimmers in a holographic configuration, and then collapses. You teleport up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space that you can see.|

|# FEATURES & TRAITS|
|CLASS FEATURES|
|RANGER’S QUARRY<br><br>Scout: 1st, 5th, 9th, and 17th level<br><br>You learn how to effectively read and track your prey. Once on each of your turns, you can choose a creature you can see within 120 feet and mark it as your quarry (no action required). For the next hour, you gain the following benefits:<br><br>  <br><br>- Once per turn, when you hit the target with a weapon attack, you can deal 1d4 additional damage to it of the same type as the weapon’s damage. This die changes as you gain scout levels, as shown in the Ranger’s Quarry column of the scout table.<br>    <br>- You have advantage on any Wisdom (Perception) or Wisdom (Survival) check you make to find it while it’s on the same planet as you.<br>    <br>- You can only have one creature marked in this way at a time. Beginning at 5th level, you can use your reaction to mark a creature when it enters your line of sight, provided it is within range of your Ranger’s Quarry.<br>    <br><br>  <br><br>The duration increases to 8 hours at 9th level and 24 hours at 17th level.<br><br>  <br>  <br><br>PATHFINDER<br><br>Scout: 1st level<br><br>You are skilled at navigating the untamed wilds. You ignore difficult terrain, and when traveling for an hour or more, you gain the following benefits:<br><br>  <br><br>- Difficult terrain doesn’t slow your group, provided they can see and hear you.<br>    <br>- You can’t become lost by unenhanced means.<br>    <br>- Even when you are engaged in another activity while traveling (such as foraging, navigating, or tracking), you remain alert to danger.<br>    <br>- If you are traveling alone, you can move stealthily at a normal pace.<br>    <br>- When you forage, you find twice as much food.<br>    <br>- You have advantage on Survival checks.<br>    <br><br>  <br>  <br><br>TECHCASTING<br><br>Scout: 2nd level<br><br>You have derived powers from schematics with the aid of your wristpad. See chapter 10 for the general rules of techcasting and chapter 12 for the tech powers list.<br><br>  <br>  <br><br>FIGHTING STYLE<br><br>Scout: 2nd level<br><br>You adopt a particular style of fighting as your specialty. Choose one of the fighting style options, detailed in Chapter 6.<br><br>  <br>  <br><br>FORMATION STYLE<br><br>You are skilled at fighting with a partner. While an ally is within 5 feet of you, you gain the following benefits:<br><br>  <br><br>- You can take the Guard action as a bonus action. If you could already take the Guard action as a bonus action, you can instead take it as a reaction on your turn.<br>    <br>- When you move on your turn, you can use a bonus action to allow a willing ally within 5 feet of you to move with you (no action required by the ally). The ally must end this movement within 5 feet of you, and this movement can’t exceed the ally’s speed.<br>    <br>- When you choose to let an attack that would hit a guarded ally hit you instead, the creature rolls the damage as normal instead of choosing the maximum.<br>    <br><br>  <br>  <br><br>SCOUT ROUTINE<br><br>Scout: 3rd, 7th, 9th, 15th, and 17th level<br><br>You’ve developed one routine, as detailed at the end of the class description. You develop an additional routine at 7th and 15th level.<br><br>  <br><br>At 9th level, the range of your routines increases to 15 feet, and at 17th level, the range of these routines increases to 30 feet<br><br>  <br><br>RESPONDER’S ROUTINE<br><br>When you roll initiative, you can choose to add your proficiency bonus to the initiative roll and have advantage on attack rolls against creatures that have not yet acted. Alternatively, you can choose to allow each creature within 5 feet of you, including you, to add half your proficiency bonus to the initiative roll and have advantage on the first attack roll they make against a creature that has not yet acted.<br><br>  <br>  <br><br>SCOUT TECHNIQUE<br><br>Scout: 3rd, 7th, 11th, and 15th level<br><br>You choose to focus on a specific scout technique, which is detailed at the end of the class description.<br><br>TELEPORTATION TECHNIQUE<br><br>  <br>  <br><br>BONUS PROFICIENCIES<br><br>Teleportation Technique: 3rd level<br><br>You gain proficiency in tinker’s implements.<br><br>  <br>  <br><br>PERSONAL TELEPORTER<br><br>Teleportation Technique: 3rd level<br><br>You can use portable teleporters as a bonus action, instead of an action.<br><br>  <br><br>Additionally, while you are wielding a tech focus, you can use your bonus action to create a pair of linked portals: one portal appears in a space within 5 feet of you, and the other portal appears in an unoccupied space you can see up to 30 feet away. These portals last until the start of your next turn, and they are large enough to accommodate Medium and smaller creatures and objects. Portals take the appearance of an elongated, shimmering mirror, and looking through a portal, a creature can see through the linked portal as if looking through a window. A creature or object who passes through a portal immediately appears in a space within 5 feet of the linked portal. You can use your reaction to end your portals early. If a creature is partially within your portals, it is shunted back to the space it previously occupied and it must make a Dexterity saving throw against your a tech save DC. On a failed save, it takes energy damage equal to your scout level + your Intelligence modifier.<br><br>  <br><br>You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, as shown in the scout table. You regain all expended uses when you complete a short or long rest. At the beginning of each of your turns while you have a pair of portals active, you can expend a use of this feature to extend the duration of the portals until the start of your next turn (no action required).<br><br>  <br><br>The distance at which you can create portals increases at higher levels. It increases to 60 feet at 5th level, 90 feet at 9th level, 150 feet at 13th level, 300 feet at 17th level, and 1,000 feet at 20th level.<br><br>  <br>  <br><br>MARK OF THE TELEPORTER<br><br>Teleportation Technique: 3rd level<br><br>On your turn, when you deal damage to the target of your Ranger’s Quarry, and either you, your weapon, or the source of your damage have passed through your portals on this turn, when you roll below half the maximum on a damage die, you can treat the roll as if you’d rolled half the maximum on the damage die. You can only affect a number of dice up to half your Intelligence modifier (minimum of one) in this way.<br><br>  <br>  <br><br>ABILITY SCORE IMPROVEMENT<br><br>Scout: 4th, 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level<br><br>You can increase one ability score by 2, or you can increase two ability scores by 1. You can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.<br><br>+1 TO DEXTERITY, +1 TO CHARISMA<br><br>  <br>  <br><br>EXTRA ATTACK<br><br>Scout: 5th level<br><br>You can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.|

You have proficiency with tinker’s implements. You can use these and spend 1 hour and 100 cr worth of materials to construct a Tiny Device (AC 5, 1 hp). You can take the Use an Object action to have your device cause one of the following effects: create a small explosion, create a repeating loud noise for 1 minute, create smoke for 1 minute, emit an onerous smell for 1 minute. You can maintain a number of these devices up to your proficiency bonus at once, and a device stops functioning after 24 hours away from you. You can dismantle the device to reclaim the materials used to create it.<br><br>  <br><br>Trance. You only need 3 hours of sleep during a long rest to gain its benefits, instead of 6.

If you or your companions are fighting the creature, your check automatically fails. If your check succeeds, the target is charmed by you as long as it remains within 60 feet of you and for 1 minute thereafter.|

| Alice isn’t afraid. She’s short, soft, & sweet- that's Alice. She's always got a smile on her little rodent face and a cheerful twinkle in her eyes. She speaks kind words to friends and strangers alike, always with a southern twang.<br><br>  <br><br>When Alice left her home planet of Chad, she wasn’t alone. She and her partner, Dorothy, were determined to see the galaxy and live life to the fullest. They matched each other in humor, morals, and technological genius. Their adventurous hearts brought them together, and their love compelled them to stay.<br><br>  <br><br>The galaxy is not a kind place. Alice and Dorothy learned the hard way what it took to survive, but they always managed to pull through. Two adventurers, living life by their own rules. They got through by running from any problem too big handle. And, when you’re as short as Alice and Dorothy, that covers most problems. They designed their own teleportation devices so they could always stay one step ahead, making up for their lack of physical prowess with their intellect and technology. If only it were enough.<br><br>  <br><br>Being an adventurer has a price. After four years of planet-hopping, Alice and Dorothy ran afoul with some dangerous people. Some problems, you just can’t outrun. Dorothy paid the price.<br><br>  <br><br>Now… Alice is alone. Dorothy was her home, and now she's gone.<br><br>  <br><br>But Alice isn’t afraid. And she’ll be damned if she lets her grief overtake her kindness. It may be just about time to find a new home |

## BACKGROUND

Alice isn’t afraid. She’s short, soft, & sweet- that's Alice. She's always got a smile on her little rodent face and a cheerful twinkle in her eyes. She speaks kind words to friends and strangers alike, always with a southern twang. 

When Alice left her home planet of Chad, she wasn’t alone. She and her partner, Dorothy, were determined to see the galaxy and live life to the fullest. They matched each other in humor, morals, and technological genius. Their adventurous hearts brought them together, and their love compelled them to stay.  

The galaxy is not a kind place. Alice and Dorothy learned the hard way what it took to survive, but they always managed to pull through. Two adventurers, living life by their own rules. They got through by running from any problem too big handle. And, when you’re as short as Alice and Dorothy, that covers most problems. They designed their own teleportation devices so they could always stay one step ahead, making up for their lack of physical prowess with their intellect and technology. If only it were enough.  

Being an adventurer has a price. After four years of planet-hopping, Alice and Dorothy ran afoul with some dangerous people. Some problems, you just can’t outrun. Dorothy paid the price.  

Now… Alice is alone. Dorothy was her home, and now she's gone.  

But Alice isn’t afraid. And she’ll be damned if she lets her grief overtake her kindness. It may be just about time to find a new home.
