[Redact](Redact.md)'s character for [[12. Curse of Strahd 1\|12. Curse of Strahd 1]]
## Backstory

A tiefling born into a human family. But, she didn't get instantly drop kicked out of the house and die outside. Instead, her birth was much celebrated. With her entire extended family being conmen, dealers, entertainers, and leaders; her curse was considered more as a blessing, as they believed that tieflings were inclined to be charismatic and cruel. 

TL;DR, they put their hopes too high. Sure, she could talk in normal conversations, even with strangers. But, when it comes to negotiation, deals, public speaking, or awkward moments - there was no way for her to get back on foot. Garbage social skills, a family embarrassment.

She was a big nerd, though. So, she ran away and studied enchantment in a small wizarding community to prove to her family that she's not useless. After studying enough there, she ventures around other places to learn more and find nice companions.
