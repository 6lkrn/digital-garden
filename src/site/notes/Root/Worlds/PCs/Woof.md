|Every awesome story has a special dog that holds a place of the utmost importance in the story. Take John Wick and Scooby Doo for example, they wouldn't even exist in the first place if it wasn’t for the domesticated canines in their respective series. Woof, is this special dog that is going to unveil a world of pirates and sea monsters with his peculiar crew of otherworldly characters.<br><br>  <br><br>Woof was just an ordinary breed of Shiba Inu in the modern world, that drifted from town to town as a stray dog, barely surviving. He was always starving, and skinny enough that even his ribs could be seen beneath the thin skin, until a couple, a pair of humans, took him in as part of their family. He was awarded many kinds of dog food, in return for serving as the little guardian of the couple’s ancient castle, barking at whoever passed by the castle’s gate. Since then, he certainly saw the couple as his Saviors! However, his satisfying life did not last very long as the couple later fell into bankruptcy, which they made a hard decision on selling the castle. He had nowhere to go, except to follow the couple’s only son in his path of “worshipping” something called… the Emojis?<br><br>  <br><br>Not understanding humans enough, Woof mistaken the Emojis for some sort of gods, which he slowly built a belief in them to bring back the couple to him, his once happy life, but little did he know it was never going to work, that humans just used these gods as digital expressions to fill in their empty emotion. Bad things do not last forever, the Saviors’ son managed to reclaim the castle, but good things do not last forever either, which an outbreak of a deadly disease happened right after, driving the son crazy about something as they were encaged in the castle.<br><br>  <br><br>One day, Woof discovered that the Saviors’ son was practicing a mysterious, seemingly dark magic in a room through the opening gap of the door. Attempting to save the human, he quickly pushed through the door, and jumped towards the human as he barked, “Woof woof!”<br><br>  <br><br>Guess what? HE IS A FUCKING SPELLCASTING DOG! He unintentionally chanted a transformation spell with his bark, turning him into a much bigger, stronger anthropomorphic dog as they were teleported to an ocean through time and space. The now big dog with a well-toned body was shocked that he was swimming in a vast ocean besides... a drowning human? He quickly called for help without hesitation, except now he was able to bark with words, “Somebody! Help the hooman!”<br><br>  <br><br>Luckily enough, a sailing ship passed by and pulled them out from the sea, and this marked the beginning of the swashbuckling adventure of the now talking, standing naked dog onboard, in which he was given a set of clothes to cover up his muscular, attractive body.|   |   |
