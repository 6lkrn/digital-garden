(w/o [[Campaign Resources/Equipment/Items/Equipment\|equipment]] and [[Campaign Resources/Equipment/Weapons/Weapons\|Campaign Resources/Equipment/Weapons/Weapons]], putting it here so I won’t forget how he looks at least for now)

  

The land that the person now known as Rasian was born at is a hot, humid one. There are only two seasons in it – sunny and monsoon. Like many other children in a country recovering from an invasion attempt, Rasian has no idea who his parents were. The child was raised by the village they reside in. Despite the hardships they have recently endured and the immediate hardships that soon followed and lingered, the people kept their chins up. They taught the orphaned and abandoned children ways of survival and kindness. Those were notable ways of tradition, ways of the sword and ways of being amiable.

The small village by the river mouth continued rebuilding their lives in peace and quiet until one of the village elders; Girihana, had a prophetic dream about the deity [[Root/Worlds/Other worlds/NPCs/Mahtaa Waan\|Mahtaa Waan]]. She preached to the other villagers, and since she’s a very influential elder, most of the village embraced [[Root/Worlds/Other worlds/NPCs/Mahtaa Waan\|Mahtaa Waan]] into their hearts. The village elder, now dubbed the Sibyl of [[Root/Worlds/Other worlds/NPCs/Mahtaa Waan\|Mahtaa Waan]] claimed that the changeling child Rasian will play a huge part in the religion of [[Root/Worlds/Other worlds/NPCs/Mahtaa Waan\|Mahtaa Waan]]. From that on, the boy was named as Rasian in honour of the prophetic dream. He was quickly taken under the wing of the village elder, trained to be a cleric of the Gapura of [[Root/Worlds/Other worlds/NPCs/Mahtaa Waan\|Mahtaa Waan]].

[[Root/Worlds/Other worlds/NPCs/Mahtaa Waan\|Mahtaa Waan]] sent divine dreams to the village elder, to which she conveys to the other villagers who have become the followers of [[Root/Worlds/Other worlds/NPCs/Mahtaa Waan\|Mahtaa Waan]]. The deity had asked them to create strange items, to give sacrifices and to do peculiar rituals in the name of [[Root/Worlds/Other worlds/NPCs/Mahtaa Waan\|Mahtaa Waan]]. Rasian was the one taught to lead the rituals. He was a quick learner and eager to please, so before long he ended up becoming somewhat of a head [[Priest\|Priest]] in his own right, teaching other clerics and acolytes the ways and rituals of [[Root/Worlds/Other worlds/NPCs/Mahtaa Waan\|Mahtaa Waan]].

The young Rasian lived a very busy, albeit content life being the right hand man of Girihana. The old woman’s influence fuelled his own. This was when he managed to convert the rest of the villagers into followers of [[Root/Worlds/Other worlds/NPCs/Mahtaa Waan\|Mahtaa Waan]]. He thought that this was the pinnacle of his life.

It was, until Girihana had a different kind of divine dream from [[Root/Worlds/Other worlds/NPCs/Mahtaa Waan\|Mahtaa Waan]]. The deity had asked the followers to build a large deck at the end of the village. Then the deity asked them to wait. So they did. For 5 weeks they waited. The rituals stopped, the creation of things stopped, so did the sacrifices. Some followers began to question the divine dream. Rasian had to fight against the ones who turned their back from [[Root/Worlds/Other worlds/NPCs/Mahtaa Waan\|Mahtaa Waan]]. He had to justify the divine dream.

A furious storm came at the end of the 5th week.

The large deck and the village were unscathed. They found out through the pipeline that settlements nearby were demolished by the passing storm. While the villagers were confused and wondering about their next move, Girihana was bestowed with another divine dream. The followers were to prepare a feast.

It was soon revealed that the feast was for a fleet of traders. They landed at the village because the nearest port was destroyed by the storm and the next one was too far for them to reach without suffering major losses. Getting the warm welcome from the villagers made the traders stay, which in turn attracted more traders. The villagers themselves became business people, selling the strange items created for [[Root/Worlds/Other worlds/NPCs/Mahtaa Waan\|Mahtaa Waan]]. Guided by divine instructions via Girihana, it only took a few months for the small village by the river to evolve into a port town. All the time, Rasian was working tirelessly in spreading the good word of [[Root/Worlds/Other worlds/NPCs/Mahtaa Waan\|Mahtaa Waan]] to the people.

He found that sometimes, people are more susceptible to listening and agreeing when one has a similar appearance. Thus, he implemented his shape changing talents whenever he preached. He wore different faces, became different genders, looked of different ages and of a multitude of [[races\|races]]. It was uncommon for him to take the blade in the name of [[Root/Worlds/Other worlds/NPCs/Mahtaa Waan\|Mahtaa Waan]], but it is not out of the probability.

Spearheaded by Rasian, the Gapura of [[Root/Worlds/Other worlds/NPCs/Mahtaa Waan\|Mahtaa Waan]] was successful in indoctrinating more people, allowing them to build a fine temple at the new port town of Bambangan. Girihana, with her age catching up to her soon had a prophetic dream that Rasian would be the next sibyl after her. But he was to finish a quest before that could happen.

He had proven that he could recruit people for [[Root/Worlds/Other worlds/NPCs/Mahtaa Waan\|Mahtaa Waan]]. But he had never made good numbers business-wise. It would be rather unsightly for the (future) sibyl of [[Root/Worlds/Other worlds/NPCs/Mahtaa Waan\|Mahtaa Waan]] to not be able to raise huge amounts of money on his own. A shame for a deity of commerce and wealth.

The quest dictates for Rasian to leave  the town he was raised in. He was told to either raise a certain amount of money or to offer Mahta Waan an item worthy of the deity’s holiness.

He accepted the quest and bid his goodbyes to Girihana, the clerics and acolytes, and to the followers. He took only what was important to him, knowing that he would have to raise the funds for the quest himself. The changeling was first accompanied by two people – a new [[Acolyte\|Acolyte]], an [[elf\|elf]] named Alwena Carwyn and an older cleric vedalken named Orme. They boarded a ship trading spices, the captain being a new convert. Unfortunately, Orme was thrown overboard and shot at along the way from a pirate attack.

It was not the bloodshed that shook Rasian’s heart. It was the fact that he had prayed to [[Root/Worlds/Other worlds/NPCs/Mahtaa Waan\|Mahtaa Waan]] for Orme’s safety. For the first time ever, his prayer was ignored.

The ship’s surviving crew managed to survive the attack with most of their cargo intact and landed at a seaport town Acair. Alwena decided to stay, preferring the safety and comfort of the land than to risk it all at the sea again. Rasian remained with her, trading his clerical services for money and entertaining (or for some people, irking or perplexing them) with his strange rituals as a stranger in their land. He made calculations and decided that at the pace he was going, it would take too long for him to be able to acquire the funds needed for his quest.

So he bided his time, finishing up the training Alwena needed to become a full-fledged cleric of [[Root/Worlds/Other worlds/NPCs/Mahtaa Waan\|Mahtaa Waan]] before leaving her behind to flourish at Acair.

Physically alone without his entourage, but never lonely with [[Root/Worlds/Other worlds/NPCs/Mahtaa Waan\|Mahtaa Waan]] still in his heart, Rasian found himself looking for a group of people who would want to seek for magnificent treasures (or will not be missing the money in their pockets).
