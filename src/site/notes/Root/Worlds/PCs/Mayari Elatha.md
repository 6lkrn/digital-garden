[[Root/Campaigns/Players/Tauhu\|Tauhu]]'s character for [[12. Curse of Strahd 1\|12. Curse of Strahd 1]]
## Backstory 

  

TLDR  
  
Mayari Elatha is a Shadar-Kai adopted by human parents who were guards of the capital city Hewmlen Creek. She lived a childhood full of care and love, adoring her parents so much she decided to follow in their footsteps. Enrolled into the Academy of Enver for said reason, she and her childhood friend Griep the tiefling soon had a fallout with each other. She had wanted to go through the hardship while he decided to choose the easy way out.

  

Being a city guard was nice until she met Griep again in different circumstances. He was now a criminal and despite the orders she was given, she let him go. It became a secret she carried on as she was appointed into the folds of the elite Order of Bakshara, a knight order of working intimately with the monarch of Hewmlen Creek himself. Now, people were chosen into the order due to their skills, trustworthiness and obedience.

  

Although this was a huge honour in itself, Mayari still thought of the friend that she let go and tries to reason it out with herself. While she was wrestling with her self doubt, she was sent for a diplomatic mission only to find that they were betrayed by their superior, a dwarf called Hunfrid. This leads to a humiliating defeat, with few surviving, scattered knights. Mayari herself survived and came back to the capital to give her reports and to be punished for her failure.

  

To no one’s surprise it was to track the traitor down and to do so, she allied herself with the local adventurer’s guild. One of her missions brought her to a band of misfits that she is now stuck with. At least one of them - the leonin barbarian Raleigh claims to be indebted to her when she saved his life that one time. That makes being in the same vicinity with the duergar Wayhand a tad more bearable. Camping with that one drives her crazy. Please, is getting a more civilised companion a monumental thing to ask of?

  
  

Long-ass version

  

As far as she could remember, Mayari Elatha is the daughter of Chesa Elatha and Niall Elatha. Despite not being human like her parents, Mayari was never  treated as a lesser being by her parents, nor was she treated as someone greater. They loved her just like they would a biological child, giving her all the opportunity they could afford. By all means, the home she had growing up was stable,clean and loving. Her parents were not afraid of showing their affection to each other and would support one another.

  

The Elathas were guards of the Hawmeln Creek, the capital of Neilenen. The city is populated mostly by humans, but other races are welcomed and tolerated. In fact,  King Altan himself is married to a half-elf  and has a Kalashtar concubine. The city was heavily populated and heavily guarded by troops and guards like the Elathas. It was during one of their scheduled rounds that they found an abandoned dark elf child, who they adopted as their own and named Mayari. 

  

When her parents are both at work, the young Mayari would be by herself and make friends among the children of the guards and knights of Hawmlen Creek. One of her close friends is a tiefling named Griep. Their favourite pastime was to stroll around the town, pretending to be guards.

  

As they both grew into young teens, Mayari and Griep were enrolled into the Academy of Enver, wanting to be just like their parents. They wanted to serve the country that had accepted them as their own. The Academy was harsh and only took in the best, as such Mayari and Griep had to work hard. The King wanted a group of tender warriors among him, a group of hardened fighters with the ability to be gentle and diplomatic.

  

Unfortunately, Griep soon lost interest and flunked out of the academy. Although disappointed and a tad heartbroken by his choice, Mayari pushed forward to finish her studies. She was a good student, on account that she is good at listening to orders and doing what was asked of her. Mayari’s parents celebrated the graduation with a feast with the whole neighbourhood. While Mayari was happy about it, she couldn’t help but feel a bit saddened that this was not shared with her close friend Griep.

  

They began to slowly drift away from each other as Mayari became more focused on her job and Griep on his own. She soon had a different circle of friends, who are guards like herself. However, on one of her usual rounds, she found her old friend Griep involved in a crime. Left alone with Griep, she had to make a decision. Despite wanting to uphold the law, she ultimately let him go. 

  

She soon forgot the incident when she was absorbed into the Order of the Bhaskara, knights of the monarch. Her parents were ecstatic. Her obedience was something valued by the Order as they can trust her to do her job as ordered. All without them knowing she was capable of disobedience.

  

 With the Order, there was more work than just within the capital as one of their job scopes is to escort and guard the King and his flock for any diplomatic event. At times, they would be the diplomats themselves, especially to war torn allies.

  

On one of these excursions, she was sent to a different land, only for her whole team to be ambushed and betrayed by another knight. This was a dwarf by the name of Hunfrid (giant peace in Norman Germanic) Ferra, an older knight who was her superior. Hunfrid was supposed to be the one leading them for the excursion before leading them towards the ambush instead. Almost all of the team was wiped out except a few knights who were either skillful or lucky enough managed to escape. One of them was Mayari. 

  

She then came home to Hewmlen, ashamed and bruised. Her homecoming was celebrated by her parents, who were relieved, though she soon was called to meet the King himself to present her report of the incident. She was punished for her failure in the mission and tasked to search for the traitorous Hunfrid. To fulfil her mission, Mayari took tasks from the local adventurer guild in return for information about Hunfrid, as he was an adventurer before he became a knight. After a few missions, she found herself with a ragtag group of a gnome, a leonin, a duergar and a dragonborn. They seem to be getting missions together more often than not and though the duergar at times would get on her nerves, she would think that they get along well enough. Well enough that she would fight hard for their life. It was that mindset that made her save the leonin’s life.

  

Six months in, a mission calls for them. It could spell a breakthrough for her own mission, though Mayari would not know about it yet.

  
  

## Notes

##### Place

Hawmeln Creek

  

Capital of Neilenen. It is ruled by King Altan Eldar (Turkish one who is born to fight fire) the human, with Queen Heulwen the half-elf. He has a concubine, a Kalasthar by the name Ekaitze. The King is 7th of his line, having ruled for 15 years so far. He is the eldest of 2 siblings, his sister is married to a King of a nearby ally country. The city relies heavily on their export of exquisite wine, mountain salt and magnificent armed forces. The city is built into the side of a mountain, carved into it as they mine the salt. There is a moat and stone walls around the capital. Trade is done mostly via land for the capital city. 

  

POI

  

Salt Crystal Lake

-A lake 3 days walk away from the capital where salt has seeped into it, forming crystals in it and around the surrounding flora. Some claim it has magical properties, others claim it’s just salt. However, no one really wants to stay around there. Citizens from a nearby village claim there is a cult claiming the lake and nearby cave.

  

Bleenart Vineyard

-A large vineyard just at the border of the Forest of Frieene. The vineyard is owned by two wealthy families who live on the vineyard - the Blechens, who are humans and the halflings Arthes. They are one of the main suppliers for the wine export but also the most controversial. There have been rumours of them sacrificing less competent workers to the forest in return for an abundant harvest and protection from the denizens of the forest. The guards have more than once came to investigate but there seems to be little to no evidence to connect them to the allegations.

  

##### The Order

Order of Bhaskara

  

The knights of Bhaskara are a group celebrated by the people of Neilenen for their myriad of skills and prowess. They are devoted to the monarch of the capital, be it the Eldars or another family, as long as they are the ones who rule over the capital. The order is associated with the goddess of the sun, Bhaskara who was said to be the true leader of Neilenen (all Kings and Queens are seen as her consul speaking on her behalf) and holds her banner, with the symbol of sun rays. The knights however, are not necessarily followers of Bhaskara herself. 

  

They work as the monarch’s bodyguards, servants and attaches, though sometimes they are required to be diplomats and emissaries on behalf of the monarch. These knights are versatile and loyal, any traitors are condemned to a punishment under the harsh sun. You can retire out of the order, though one is forever contained to life inside the country if one chooses to retire before the age.

  

The current head of the order is a Minotaur named Asterion who is strict with work and his subordinates, but enjoys the wine a bit too much.

  

##### People

  

The Parents

  

Niall and Chelsea Elatha are guards of the capital city Hewmlen Creek, married for 10 years, in love with each other longer than that and wanting children of their own since the first year they were wed. Unfortunately, no matter how hard they try it does not seem to be for them. It was only a change in their life when they found a lost child while they went on their routine rounds outside the city walls. The small child caught their hearts and soon became the light of their life. They named her Mayari, the moon so she would complement the capital city that is the sun. It made them proud when she wanted to follow their footsteps, even prouder when she was accepted into the innerfolds of the sun deity that shines their grace on their ruler. As people of the law, they expect their child to uphold it.

  

Griep 

  

Mayari’s neighbour and childhood best friend. He too, is a child of a guard, though his mother works as a grape harvester in Bleenart Vineyard and does housekeeping for the city’s main inn outside harvesting season. He is a rambunctious tiefling who aspired to be a guard like his father, although he soon gave up when the studies became harder. He came back into her life as a criminal who she decided against her orders to let go.Griep is a Thief who is good with his hands and laid back, though he can be very resourceful when he is in trouble.

  

Asterion Synnefa

  

The current head for the Order Of Bhaskara. He has been the head for 10 years, working his way up from a mere guard and making connections as he went. He believes in what his subordinates like to call 3 Hs -hard work, honesty, and humility. Asterion tries his best to take care of his subordinates, giving them tasks properly and shielding them from unnecessary judgement, though he is strict in reprimanding them. Due to his workaholic mindset, he can be a bit unaware of social cues.

  

Mizette Rea

  

Mizette was a wood elf who became part of the Order a few years ahead of Mayari. During their time together, she was Mayari’s partner. She was in-training to become a superior under Hufrid’s tutelage. Unfortunately, he betrayed them all on the diplomatic mission. Even more unfortunate, she was one of the knights that had died from the betrayal. Mizette was a knight that joined the Order to prove herself to her family. She was fragile-looking and seemed to always be sick, but combatted that by being ingenious and diligent. One thing she was good at was making and disarming traps.

  

##### Secrets

  

-   Mayari thought that maybe her superiors did find out of her disobedience and they’re sending her out to hunt for Hunfrid in a suicide mission - or that Griep was somehow involved in all of this.
    

  

##### Goals

Short term goal - Catch Hunfri

  

Med term goal - Restore the faith of the Order in me

  

Long term goal - Becoming the Head of the Order.
