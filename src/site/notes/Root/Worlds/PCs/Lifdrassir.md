# LiFDRASSIR ORTISDOTTIR

She was raised since infancy in the church of Morian the Preserver. In the Life district of Ealdun. Her life was pretty much set from the get go to be a priest or cleric. Being her race and all it was not hard to take her in to begin with.

The church functions as a sanctuary for the sickly and vulnerable. Therefore, she was trained to deal with medicines and general care. The term sickly would then extend to that of animals also. She had experience with taking care of various animals most notably an owlbear that she managed to get close to and even give them a name that they responded too.

She was considered an outlier when it comes to the views of her faith. Rather she hardly focused on class when it comes to the translation of scriptures. This caused her to butt heads with the governing body several times but despite all that, she did show her own aptitude in understanding the actual teaching in said scriptures. While she did not necessarily agree with the translations or teaching she did see the significance of it. she just preferred to come up with her own explanations.

Her contributions to the faith further extends as she reached adolescence. When she was old and strong enough to carry loads of an adventuring gear, she joined a sect that was dedicated to supplying relief effort to any impoverished township or areas affected by disasters. Such expeditions require them to be both resilient and self sufficient. She excelled in most of it as long as it does not require she does something that require finesse. Continuing to participate in the expeditions, she managed to complete up to 14 outreaches. Considering the effort and resource required to even go to one and complete them it was considered admirable. In her 15th venture, she went out with others and a group of adventurers only to never return.

There’s searches made of her party and expedition. Only to find a devastated town looted to the bedrock with a hint of Brimstone and sulphur filling the air.

She was considered MIA until she returned at the doorstep of the church looking rather frazzled and changed while not drastic, she seemed more… subdued. It had been 5 years. She seemed to lost herself once more as all the health checks have been made. Only sitting in her room praying, eating and bathing. But that soon change when somehow she regained her light in her eyes. She looked hopeful once more and reaffirmed herself in the teachings of Morian.
