What can be certain of Sabina would be that she frequents the back alleys and red light districts. Should be pressed for the reasons why, her answer would be around the likes of 'meeting friends or clients'. Something vague and not at all a good image on her for the most part, though despite all the comments thrown around, she did not show any form of offence on it. 

There's always a vibe of understanding on her that would be frightening to some people. Where she can cut through the façade and get to the crux of the matter.

Her practice was that of a psychologist and admittedly an odd fit in the Famiglia setup. Hired by the Head of the organisation for reasons only known to Him.

As to her views on the Head and the families, her reasoning would be along the lines of : 'I owed them.', 'I respect them.', 'I understand their reasoning.'

Totally a normal human being. Don’t mind his…… libido— after all, girls just wanna have fun~

He wears a fox mask at all times; the only people who know what his face looks like are his two brothers. One of his brothers—Nova Ampora—is also in the mafia as a hired muscle.

Gumiho’s position in the mafia is as a spy of sorts.
