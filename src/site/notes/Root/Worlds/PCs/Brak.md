|# DESCRIPTION|
|Back in 45 BBY, before the official BB-series astromech droid was released and commonly employed by the society, the Industrial Automaton assembled only a limited number of prototype BB units, of which BB-O1 was one of them, being the very first few rolling astromech units ever created in the galaxy. However, BB-O1 was stolen by a group of smugglers, which it then got traded between several hands until it eventually met its first master, a young woman named ??? who wore an iron helmet. ??? was a total tech geek who treated BB-O1 extremely well, and even gave the BB droid some amazing modifications such as built-in weapons and stealth mods. BB-O1 slowly developed a lively, cheeky personality as it followed its master, fighting together as a team.<br><br>  <br><br>However, during one mission, the two got separated from each other by their enemies, and BB-O1 had to follow its master’s order, which was to escape with the ship and leave the master behind, which it did. Ever since then, it stopped hearing from its master, but it has not given up looking for her. Coming across several strangers, it accepted them as companions and allowed them to get onboard the ship, aiming to achieve their personal goals with the aid of each other.|
