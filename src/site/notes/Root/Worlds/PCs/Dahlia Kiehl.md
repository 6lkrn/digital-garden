## Dahlia Kiehl

She is a student at Queensland University of Technology. Studying Urban Planning as her major. Balancing her pointers, social life and along with part time jobs. It’s very demanding but she managed to push through it.

Her spare time when she wasn’t studying and doing her jobs is dabbling in the occult. Through her dabbling, she met with a fellow practitioner and senior Claire Brielle Mont-Blanc. From there, they’ve had a student-teacher relationship in exploring the esoteric field that is the occult.
