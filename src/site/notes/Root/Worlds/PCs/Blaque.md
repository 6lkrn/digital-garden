[Mason](Mason.md)’s Character: ?????? “The Skullseeker” Blaque for [[Root/Campaigns/As DM/6. Depths of Villainy/6. Depths of Villainy\|6. Depths of Villainy]]

Raised by a band of outlaws, ?????? shared most of his time learning from the scum of the world. Taught the underhanded ways of the world, he eventually grew wise enough to outwit and betray the hands that once fed him and lured them into a trap that ended in their capture, trading his “Brothers” for a full bag of gold. From there, he would start out his short lived, yet notorious career as a highwayman, ambushing unsuspecting travellers in the cover of dusk and basking in their treasures after a night of thievery.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A notorious young outlaw found himself in the apprehension of a band of adventurers. One moment he was robbing a carriage, the next, pinned on the ground by an [[orc\|orc]] and a [dragonborn](Dragonborn.md).

An elven woman smirked smugly, knelt down on a single knee and looked down at the young [human](Human.md).

“Hm….?????? “The Terror of the Night Road” Blaque. [Human](Human.md), a black left eye and a red right eye. A scar on the right eye. Last seen wearing a black leather jacket, black trousers, and black leather boots. Certainly fits all the descriptions, but…..a child?”  
  
?????? struggles and lets out a grunt, the seetheful look on his face unwavering even under apprehension.  

The [elf](Elf.md) sat down on the grass in front of him.“ Aren’t you supposed to be, I don’t know, reading a book or something? What do kids do nowadays, Rogar?” The [[orc\|orc]] pinning him down mutters something in orcish and lets out a hearty laugh, to which the [elf](Elf.md) lets out a cheery sigh and rolls her eyes. “Not everyone is as much of a charmer as you are, you big goof.”

??????spits at her feet. “You’d never understand. You wouldn’t know what I had to go through to get here. What else would someone like me be good f-”

“Yada-yada, tragic backstory, we get it. However, that does not give you an excuse to benefit off the suffering of others, much less harming them. Do you really think no one else has had misfortunes befall them?”.The [elf](Elf.md) shot him a look of indifference, disregarding his disrespectful demeanor, and retorted back in a dismissive tone. 

?????? looks to the side, as if trying to avoid her question and face the answer.

“What are you good for? Well, how about we find out? We were promised a hefty sum for turning you in, dead or alive. How about this, little one. Join us, and I will personally show you how much you’re capable of. We will put those skills of yours to good use, where you can help instead of harm. Sounds good?”

?????? looks up towards the [elf](Elf.md) leaning down towards him. She seemed genuine enough, the face that was projecting a condescending smirk warmed up into a benevolent, gentle smile. “Wherever the gold leads me, I follow.”, muttered the young [human](Human.md) reluctantly. The [elf](Elf.md) let out a tiny giggle, “Well, I’ll take that as a yes for now”. The [elf](Elf.md) signalled the [[orc\|orc]] and [dragonborn](Dragonborn.md), and got off him. She offers ?????? a hand, beaming a grin at him. “[[Root/Worlds/Caermor/NPCs/Cynthia\|Cynthia]], pleased to make your acquaintance. Wanna be friends?”. 

The [human](Human.md) looks at her hand, then at her face. He reluctantly takes her hand, gets up, and dusts himself off. “What’s….a friend?”. The [elf](Elf.md) rolls her eyes again. “I guess we’ll have a lot to teach you. Come now little one, let's get you cleaned up and fed”. She pats his head lightly and guides him towards the carriage.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
He joins them. seeing [Cynthia](Cynthia.md) as a mother figure, helearns under her guidance. These would be the happiest years of his life, where he would slowly learn to trust others, learnt new skills, and saw his potential for good for the very first time.
  

Under [Cynthia](Cynthia.md)’s guidance, ?????? learnt how to read and write, as well as some other interpersonal skills that were previously much lacking..  
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

“Hey [Cynthia](Cynthia.md), I wanna ask you something”, said ?????? as he placed a cigarette firmly between his lips.

“Hm? What is it, munchkin?”, replied the [elf](Elf.md) in a cheeky tone, tilting her head towards him.

?????? scoffed at her. “Tch. I told you to stop calling me that. I’m a grown up now”.  
  
She giggled, patting his head, “Yes yes, whatever you say. What did you want her to ask?”.

He shook her hand off his head, shooting a sharp glare before turning his face away into the moonlight. “Why were you so quick to trust me when we first met? Weren’t you afraid that I would betray you guys? What if I shot you in the back as soon as you turned your back towards me?”

The [elf](Elf.md) pondered for a moment. “Well, I did consider the possibility. However, trust is the rope that holds the bridges of companionship together. I wanted to show that we trusted you. That was your first test. I knew of the risks it entailed, but I saw it in your eyes when we first met that you weren’t inherently evil. I wanted to believe you were good”. As ?????? lit up a match to light his cigarette, [Cynthia](Cynthia.md) blew out the match and snatched the cigarette away out of his mouth. “Hey hey, that's not good for you! As I was saying, I wanted to show you warmth and kindness, in hopes that you’d grow up to be a wonderful man. I could see it in your eyes, that you could be kind, that you could be something more than just a petty criminal”.

?????? chuckled at her response. “Yeah? I have pretty high standards to live up to then, huh? I really don’t know if I can become what you think I can be.”

The [elf](Elf.md) dismissed his remark. “Well, I know so. If you don’t believe in yourself, then you’re not believing in me!”. The [elf](Elf.md) pouted, ears turning downwards. He rolled his eyes in response.“Yes yes, whatever you say, mom”. The both shared a giggle as the moonlight lit their surroundings.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

“You ready?”. ?????? responded with a swift nod. [Cynthia](Cynthia.md) threw 5 glass bottles high up into the air. As they had practiced, ??????  swiftly drew his pistols as they hit the apex of their ascent. Firing his pistols in rapid succession, each shot carefully calculated, yet swift as lightning. Shards of glass rained from the sky, and a single bottle landed with a thump onto the grass. 

Rogar cheered and clapped, and Jacques the [dragonborn](Dragonborn.md) applauded him the same. “Very impressive greenhorn, to think that just a day ago you could only get one”. ?????? turned towards him as he was reloading his pistols for another volley of lead, his lips shaping into a shit-eating grin. “What can I say? I’m a natural”. Jacques chuckled lightly, “Hah, no denying that. You’re the most talented sharpshooter I’ve seen. At this rate, you’ll be stealing all our valor, kid.”

?????? scoffed at the flattery. He had an ego, but he knew better than to let it get to his head. He knew they wanted him to be more confident, but what he had in his skillset wasn’t confidence, it was trust. One that bonded his mind, body, and weapon.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The rapid cracking of gunshot and shattering glass echoed through the woods, one quickly followed by another. “Faster, ??????, faster!”. The loud thundering roared through the coniferous forest, as the will and determination of a young [human](Human.md) and the pistols he wielded set forth bellowing echoes that tore through the ambience of the night. After a while, the sounds ceased.

The young [human](Human.md) panted heavily, wiping beads of sweat from his forehead. [Cynthia](Cynthia.md) stepped out of the foliage of the woods, panting in exhaustion herself. She had been running circles around the clearing, throwing bottles into the air from random directions at an increasingly rapid pace. “Wow, your reflexes have undoubtedly improved by over a tenfold since the first time we did this.” Hand on his knees, ?????? nodded back, too out of breath to speak. The tall [elf](Elf.md) placed her hand on his shoulder. “I want you to remember ??????, never hesitate when you get a clear shot at our target”. The [human](Human.md) arched his back, then leaned back to his full height. “What if one of you are in the line of fire? I...don’t want to hurt any of you. You’re all good friends of mine”. 

[Cynthia](Cynthia.md) shook her head, “We’ll be fine. Follow my lead, and have faith in my decisions. However, most importantly, have faith in yourself.. I’ve watched you grow from a silly child to….well, a less silly child. We believe in you, and you should too. Your egoist facade might fool others, but it can’t get past me, y’know”. He shot her a doubtful look as [Cynthia](Cynthia.md) ruffled his hair. “C’mon, I practically raised you. You know I can practically read your mind, right?”.

?????? looked at her and chuckled. “Tch, fine. You got me there”. [Cynthia](Cynthia.md) smiled brightly and took his hand. “C’mere, I have something for you”. She led him back to the campsite where Rogar and Jacques were residing. The two of them greeted the pair with song and dance. ?????? froze in a mix of astonishment, happiness, and confusion. A feast was laid out in front of them. [Cynthia](Cynthia.md) rushed into her tent and returned swiftly with a dark wooden briefcase. Rogar smiled and wrapped his arm around ??????, while Jacques chuckled merrily. “Happy birthday, kid! You turn, what, eighteen today?”. ?????? smiled sheepishly. “Yeah, I suppose I do, huh?”. [Cynthia](Cynthia.md) presented the briefcase gleefully to ??????. “Tadaaaa!! Go on, go on, open it up!”.

With a click of a heavy brass button, the briefcase popped open. Inside the velvet lined mahogany container sat two gorgeous pepperboxes. Black dragonhorn grips have been embedded into them, and the metal was given a dark matte black finish. Engraved on each of the back of the grips was a “C” with a heart surrounding it.

“You like ‘em? We had them custom made for you! But with such gorgeous [[Campaign Resources/Equipment/Weapons/Weapons\|Campaign Resources/Equipment/Weapons/Weapons]], it is only right we give them names that do it justice”, pondered the [elf](Elf.md), her face clearly depicting she was in a state deep in thought. 

As the gang feasted and drank into the night, they threw out suggestions on names to bestow the pair of pistols, but nothing seemed to stick. Twin Dragonfangs? Seems unbefitting for a pair of firearms. Thunder and Lightning? No, way too cheesy. Skullcrushers? Too violent.

After an hour of drunken rambling, the gang started to doze off. Suddenly, [Cynthia](Cynthia.md) perked up with excitement “Oh oh! What about…...[Cynthia’s Faith](Cynthia’s%20Faith.md) and [Cynthia’s Wisdom](Cynthia’s%20Wisdom.md). Think about it! The left one will be named Faith, since that is what I leave you with, and the right one will be named Guidance, since my wisdom keeps you on the right path? And they will always be by your sides! Clever, isn’t it?”. She placed her hands on her hips, clearly beaming with pride at her idea in a drunken stupor.

?????? struggled to hold back his laughter at the sound of it, but it was too late. [Cynthia](Cynthia.md) flicked him on the forehead. “Hey! Don’t laugh at me! I’m serious!”. At this point, he broke into a complete fit of laughter. [Cynthia](Cynthia.md) pouted at him and stood up “So mean! You know what, come up with your own name, you mean little brat. I’m going to bed, Hmph!”. She kept her word, and quickly stormed off into the tent.

Unbeknownst to her, ?????? had gone through with her idea. He spent the next few hours of the night admiring his new guns, [[Cynthia’s Faith\|Cynthia’s Faith]] and [[Cynthia’s Wisdom\|Cynthia’s Wisdom]].

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

One day, during a heated hunt for a dragon troubling a town, tragedy befell; after an hour of intense combat, the wounded dragon pinned [Cynthia](Cynthia.md) down as they were chasing the creature to the town’s coal mine. In a flash of a moment that would sear into his memory, he heard the words of his captain bellow across to his position. 

"??????, take the shot!"

In a moment of horror and ingenuity, he saw the leader holding a bundle of dynamite as they were pinned by the titanic claws of the dragons. His life would change in that one pull of a trigger. As the hammer of [Cynthia](Cynthia.md)’s Faith slammed and fired a well aimed shot

onto the stick of dynamite, the coal mine burst into an inferno and engulfed the dragon, as it collapsed onto the ground. The citizens of the town gathered and cheered for him, while the rest of the party looked at him in horror. Unable to deal with the guilt of what was revered as a heroic deed, and the calamity of emotions that was soon to befall his party members, he ran away as far as he could. A hero overnight, yet the killer of his very own master. In an ironic twist, with the very [[Campaign Resources/Equipment/Weapons/Weapons\|Campaign Resources/Equipment/Weapons/Weapons]] she bestowed him.

Now a gun without a master, ?????? became a notorious mercenary, providing his services to the highest bidder. Eventually known as the "The Skullseeker" in the industry, he used his skills for himself, never distinguishing between good and evil. In his career, he would end up working with criminal organisations who wanted his former party members and their new groups dead.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The smell of smoke and black powder litters the air. The group could hear their horses galloping away frantically in the cover of the dusk.

But it was too late.

A young [elf](Elf.md) hurried to wake up his companions as the smell of gunpowder filled his nostrils. He was here. It had to be him.

An old [[Orc\|Orc]] grabs his axe and places his hand on the shoulders on the frame of his petite elven friend.

"Don't worry, we're prepared for this. Think of all we've gone through. Think of how much you have grown before you were here. Remember, you are stronger than you think".

The [elf](Elf.md) beamed a nervous but passionate smile, "Y-yeah, you're right! We can't falter now. We'll make it thr-"

Before the words could find their footing in the air, a loud crack thundered all around, and the elves head exploded, the soft innards and fluid splattering the [[orc\|orc]] as his body collapsed on the ground, now devoid of all his youthful spirit. 

The next noise was a sharp whistle. As the [[orc\|orc]] turned his head in the direction, a silhouette emerged from the smoke and fire that surrounded him and his companions.

"Are you here for us now? Why are you doing this? What did we do to deserve this?". The [[orc\|orc]]'s furious inquisition bellowed through the woods, seemingly piercing the acrid head surrounding them.

Two flashes of light came from the silhouette, and along came the thundering roars of the device that brought its fate to heroes and evildoers alike.

The first shot grazed the ear of the [[orc\|orc]], and the second found its mark in the skull of another one of the [[orc\|orc]]'s companions.

Another shot whizzed through the air as it drilled through the eye of the [[orc\|orc]]'s last companions, tunneling to the back of his skull.

"Answer me! Why? What would [Cynthia](Cynthia.md) think of all your acti-"

A bullet slided gracefully against the left cheek of the [[orc\|orc]], over an old wound that was inflicted by the dragon the two slain when they themselves were companions

The silhouette sauntered closer, and the sound boots digging into the heels of the soil of the forest, the figure finally spoke, "Do not. Speak.Her name".

"How long do you think you can run from your guilt? How long do you think you can live this facade of a heroic vigilante? How long before everyone finds out about your past?"

With a click of a trigger, a clack of a hammer, and the sliding of a cylinder of a pepperbox, it roared and tore a shot into life, seemingly inheriting the impunitive rage of its wielder. 

The [[orc\|orc]] was knocked into the air onto the ground, barely conscious. His axe was flung aside in a second shot that sent it flying into the flames. It was a spectacle to behold for any, and could be the greatest achievement of any marksman. But it was him. 

Undoubtedly, this was him.

As a final shot rang into the air, the cracking of an [[orc\|orc]]'s thick skull followed.

?????? walked into the campsite surrounded by flame and smoke, his cheeks burning from the heat that was engulfing him, as well as by a mix of both guilt, anger, and sorrow.

He whispered softly, "I'm sorry old friend. It's just business. Maybe in another life, we would have been the best cooks in Lerauch. But tonight, my eye is sharper than your axe. May you rest in peace."

As ?????? walked away from the scene, he pulled out a cigarette and ran it through the fence of flame that surrounded the site. After a few paces, he stopped short, taking in a hearty pull.

"Hero, Killer, why does it matter? I never wanted to be what they said I was anyway. I never asked to be a hero”.
