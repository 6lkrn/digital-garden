[[Root/Campaigns/Players/RMC\|RMC]]'s Char for [[Root/Campaigns/As DM/6. Depths of Villainy/6. Depths of Villainy\|6. Depths of Villainy]]

I am a crazy rich [[Cultist\|cultist]] pastor 🤑  who translated the holybook (*cough* not bible) to emojis/icons in order to "modernise" and reach out to the younger generation.  It was a HUGE HIT. # minimalist # lesswordsmoreemojis I earned enough money to buy back the ancient castle that my parents had to sold when we went bankrupt. 🏰

Since young, I was told my lineage was bestowed with a certain power but my family was too busy grinding and just surviving day-to-day. We didnt even have the time to discover and learn our gift. 🌟

Then, Covid-19  🦠 😷 hit and I wasn't allowed to go out. I was stuck in an ancient castle with my dog, Woofy. 🏰 🐕 I kinda became a madman because I started to hallucinate some strange voices telling me about the power. 🗣 One day, I followed the voice and discovered a secret room that leads to an old book that wrote about this power that fed on benevolence and kindness, and its purpose was to extend the aiding of the deity who bestowed my lineage the gift.✨

There was also a spell inside that talked about time travel and I (stupidly) just read it out loud, not knowing that I ACTUALLY still have powers within me, so the spell WORKED 🪄. The next thing I know I'm awake in THE MIDDLE OF THE FREAKING OCEAN AND I CANT SWIM. I almost died (keyword: _almost_) but luckily Woofy was with me, they managed to bark for help and a stranger was fishing. He spotted us and brought us to his boat. 😇

After a few days of rest, I realised that I'm in another world, somehow things are a bit historical...? (WHAT YEAR IT IS 🤔 )  And to my dismay, it seems like this world does not have EMOJIs :c (TRUE TRAGEDY)

Now that I lost what I know best (yes, emojis), I need to learn how to survive and also how to cultivate my power because it seems like this world is full of magic and wonders, which is new and exciting to me. 🤩

And it turns out Woofy can speak! The first thing he said was STOP CALLING ME WOOFY MY NAME IS [[Root/Worlds/PCs/Woof\|Woof]] 🐶 (#TIL)

:') 

Oh, there's also plenty of gold here so I'm ready to earn them monies 💰💰💰 (#GETRICHQUICK)

-wants: MONEY

-needs: to know why i’m here and why do i have magikkkkk what is this cleric thingy… ohhhhhh also do i want to go back? Can i just jump to the time where covid is over? 

-fears: I cant swim, so I might drown anytime. I need to learn what is the spell to stay afloat of course. I can always learn swimming tomorrow, but I can only learn spells in this new world. # prioritites
