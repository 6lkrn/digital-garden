### Background
Hailing from the remote hilly, coniferous forests off the border of a dwarven kingdom, the remote village of Viangpha Mork is host to a cozy, cool climate, housing a plethora of races, from human refugees to minotaur settlers.  
  
However, make no mistake, as the village raises its own band of warriors raised to defend the village from every possible threat. The Elite Vanguard of Viangpha Mork has seen its fair share of goblin invasions to "code dragons". These warriors are trained to be as tough as titanium, under the supervision of a retired veteran dwarven general who has settled in the village. They are well versed in combat, and only combat. For them, combat is their lifestyle and their calling in life.  
  
Once a member of an elite vanguard has proved their worth, they are allowed to serve as subsidiaries of the dwarven with the other members of the vanguard. In return, the dwarven kingdom compensates the village with material sources. This also gives the member a trial by fire to truly test their mettle in the battlefield.

### **Military Rank**

You have a military rank from your career as a soldier. Soldiers loyal to your former military organization still recognize your authority and influence, and they defer to you if they are of a lower rank. You can invoke your rank to exert influence over other soldiers and requisition simple equipment or horses for temporary use. You can also usually gain access to friendly military encampments and fortresses where your rank is recognized.
