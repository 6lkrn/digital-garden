### The Lin Family

The Lin Family once consisted of just three brothers living in poverty: Cyrus, Azad, and Ava. They started off as a modest shipping and transport company, but rose to prominence during the war smuggling various magical goods... and beings. By the end of the war, the Lin Shipping Company had rebranded into just the Lin Corporation.

There are currently three main branches of the Lin Family. Cyrus, as the oldest brother, is the head of the family. Azad and Ava seem content to follow his orders and direction. As to whether their children and associates are content with that state of affairs... that's another matter entirely.

Their many and varied businesses include:

- Gambling operations
    
- Drugs
    
- Loan sharking
    
- Extortion
    
- Protection rackets
    
- Construction (including fees to ensure your building gets constructed at all)
    
- Demolition (including protection fees against demolition)
    
- Trucking, shipping, docks industry, etc.
    
- Information brokering 
    
- Smuggling (of goods and people)
    
- Art (aka money laundering)

#### Guns and Order

Of the three brothers, Cyrus Lin runs his family with the sternest hands. When he met Esther, he was 18 and she 27; she served during the war as a naval aviator and pilot; after  the war she studied business.

Cyrus is a man with a severe face. At 47, he has recently started transferring power to his eldest son.

Esther Yu is the current public face of the Lin Family. Dressed always in her iconic sharp, white suits, she hides the Family's activities with a deceitfully gentle smile.

Sami, the eldest, is 28 years old. Following in his mother's footsteps, he is primarily in charge of the Family's more above-board businesses--construction, shipping, etc. His brother Darius is his right-hand man.

Benny and Elaine are Cyrus' mistresses; Esther tolerates them, but only because she strictly restricts their activities to the house they live in. Neither have stepped outside the house since Cyrus took them in. Rana, 26, dreams of taking over Lily's place in the Family. She is currently studying law.

| Lily Lin<br><br>she/her, 23 years old<br><br>  <br><br>![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/C44HLFRj6MFy_QeVsMblE-Ys08mds9MTudUWSyTVhz_CAkgtGhPNhgRHfmz6pv3b8xBWF8xbVNi4PqqlDcniZTwObvsWahZDxumDvdAo4RP4XLh_-sYstc_Xl9dfPluq7vzo7Dgh8cBsubMw9mMQ6ZI)<br><br>  <br><br>The only daughter of the Lin Family. (Rana? Flora? Mikaela? Who are they? They don't matter.) She grew up spoiled by her parents, following after her brothers like a little, devilish shadow. Darius taught her how to shoot; Sami bought her the gun she keeps in her purse. She was largely untouched during the war, being well protected by her family. She was 9 when it started. She remembers a childhood of poverty, but only vaguely.<br>Lily Lin has the effortless charm of a girl who grew up pretty and rich. Socially, she's a wolf in designer wool. She gets driven around in armored vehicles and for her 18th birthday, she got a private jet, which she rents out to her fleet of pretty socialite friends and mob followers. Her favorite color is red. <br>  <br>She attended the Baylor Coast Academy--the most expensive school in the city. She then went on to study Fashion Design, where she learned that getting other people to do her coursework was the key to success.<br>  She currently runs a small jewelry chain, Faery Tales, targeted towards rich pre-teen girls. The designs are dubiously sourced but charming. <br>She owns two apartments, a beachfront property, and is currently in the middle of renovating a warehouse to turn into an artists' enclave. She also invests in indie films and enjoys supporting the local music scene. She's currently into an EDM band called Quantum Fiziks. |
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             

  

### Second Branch Family

#### Protection Agency
Azad is the second Lin brother. He takes care of the usual stereotypical mobster business: Gambling, drugs, racketeering, extortion, prostitution. He's never met a problem he couldn't beat into submission, a source of tension between him and his brothers--both of whom prefer more delicate solutions to problems, especially in the Lin Family's current state: a mafia family wearing mask of legitimacy.

Unlike Cyrus and Ava, he has no family; his wife died during the war, and he seems disinterested in anyone else. He does, however, have a small gang of "Captains", each of whom lead a group of associates (gangsters) whose main task is politely asking (threatening) people into paying the various fees (protection money) they owe the Family: Raqael, "One-Eye" Gantz, Rusty Ivan and Nicky Mick.
### Third Branch Family

#### We know all your secrets...

  ![](https://i.imgur.com/UxoP0y9.png)


  

The Lin Family's Third Branch is headed by Ava Lin, the youngest Lin brother.

He oversees the jokingly named "spy division" of the Family, trading in information and secrets.

(He also runs brothels.)

If Ava had a dick, there'd probably be an army of little Avas underfoot. As it is, Ava has managed to give birth to an impressive three children, fathered by his "wives", various mistresses, one-night-stands, and "business associates". He is currently pregnant with his sixth child.

He currently has four men he keeps as "wives", who raise his children for him. The children he gives them to raise aren't necessarily theirs by blood; the choice seems to be entirely random. He has no favorites among his children: he is equally indifferent to all.
