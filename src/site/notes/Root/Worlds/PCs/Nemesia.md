Nav'Nemesia'Moti

  
  

Nav’Nemesia’Moti, or Nemesia was born a small, ill baby after a complicated childbirth. She was not expected to survive both due to her condition and the nature of her delivery. Her parents were not quick to give up on their first child, though and tried their best to get her the medical attention she needed. Her ailment was a tad rare and required her to often visit a laboratory to be monitored and prodded.

  

Growing up as a frail child, Nemesia spent most of her time with books. She grew jealous of other children and her brother for being able to spend time outside, though. Time spent travelling between home and the lab was the one she looked forward to daily.

  

She grew to be steadily stronger as she aged, mostly due to the constant medical attention she had and partly out of pure spite and need to satisfy her curiosity. Her chance came when she got in contact with an academy looking for new students. Despite her parents’ protests, Nemesia quickly signed up. She lied about the admission date and snuck out of their home to get into the academy.

  

Her gamble paid off when she was a) accepted into it and b) her parents could not take her out of it. She threw herself into her studies, though her heart soon yearned again to be outside. Though this time, she set her sights on space. She felt that with her stronger body, she could do *anything* she wanted to.

  

This time, without her parents even knowing, she took piloting classes, wanting to control her own ship. However, after her graduation she learnt that it would take too long for her to be able to save up enough credits to buy herself a ship.

  

She settled with piloting other people’s ships instead. Sometimes, she would offer navigational or mapping services - all to be able to save up money for the ship she wants. In one of her jobs, she came across an Echani named [[Root/Worlds/PCs/Kaelan\|Kaelan]] who she thought to be an interesting person. They did a job together -sending out cargo to Ruuria to Bonadan, where they split up when she found a different crew to work with. She then headed to Raxus Prime and was stiffed by the crew and marooned. Miffed but still determined, she wandered through the toxic planet trying to find a new crew. When she failed to do so, she thought of getting herself a ship.

  

As she browsed through the marketplace, she found herself admiring a certain droid instead. She pushed the idea of a ship and quickly purchased the droid. In a stroke of luck, she found herself a new crew after another harrowing few weeks there. The droid followed suit and proved to be a very agreeable companion, assisting her and protecting her when needed.

  

This new crew however got attacked by some space pirates. Most of the crew were badly injured, but they survived. Nemesia herself escaped from horrific injuries thanks to her droid. A bit shaken by the event, she decided to be a bit chosy with her jobs and soon found herself in the [[Root/Campaigns/As DM/9. Star Wars/Silver Matriarch\|Silver Matriarch]]. In a twist of fate, [[Root/Worlds/PCs/Kaelan\|Kaelan]], the Echani from the past was there as well.
