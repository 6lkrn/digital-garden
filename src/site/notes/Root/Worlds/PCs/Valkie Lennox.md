|# FEATURES & TRAITS|
|CLASS FEATURES|
|Target. You learn how to effectively read and track your prey. Once on each of your turns, you can choose a creature you can see within 120 feet and mark it as your target (no action required). For the 6 hours, you gain the following benefits:<br><br>- Once per turn, when you hit the target with a weapon attack, you can deal 1d4 additional damage to it of the same type as the weapon’s damage.<br>    <br>- You have advantage on any Wisdom (Perception) or Wisdom (Survival) check you make to find it while it’s on the same planet as you.<br>    <br>- You can only have one creature marked in this way at a time.<br>    <br><br>Tracker. You are skilled at navigating the untamed wilds. You ignore difficult terrain, and when travelling for an hour or more, you gain the following benefits:<br><br>- Difficult terrain doesn’t slow your group, provided they can see and hear you.<br>    <br>- You can’t become lost by unenhanced means.<br>    <br>- Even when you are engaged in another activity while travelling (such as foraging, navigating, or tracking), you remain alert to danger.<br>    <br>- If you are travelling alone, you can move stealthily at a normal pace.<br>    <br>- When you forage, you find twice as much food.<br>    <br>- You have advantage on Survival checks.<br>    <br>-   <br>    <br><br>Grit<br><br>A Cowboy makes their mark upon the world with daring deeds. Some claim they belong to a mystical organisation, but it’s more likely that the volatile nature of combat simply prunes the unlucky and careless from their ranks. Whatever the reason, all cowboys have grit. At the start of each day, a cowboy gains a number of grit points equal to their Wisdom modifier (minimum 1). Their grit goes up or down throughout the day, but usually cannot go higher than their Wisdom modifier (minimum 1). A cowboy spends grit to accomplish deeds (see below), and regains grit in the following ways.<br><br>Critical Hit with a Weapon: Each time the Cowboy confirms a critical hit with an attack while in the heat of combat, they regain 1 grit point. Confirming a critical hit on a helpless or unaware creature does not restore grit.<br><br>Killing Blow: When the Cowboy reduces a creature to 0 or fewer hit points with an attack while in the heat of combat, they regain 1 grit point. Destroying an unattended object, reducing a helpless or unaware creature to 0 or fewer hit points does not restore any grit.<br><br>Deeds. Cowboys spend grit points to accomplish deeds. Most deeds grant them some momentary bonus or effect, but there are some that provide longer-lasting effects. Some deeds stay in effect as long as the Cowboy has at least 1 grit point. The following is the list of base deeds. Unless otherwise noted, a deed can be performed multiple successive times, as long as the appropriate amount of grit is spent to perform the deed.<br><br>Deadeye: The Cowboy can ignore the disadvantage for attacks made at long range. Performing this deed costs 1 grit point. <br><br>Cowboy’s Dodge: The Cowboy gains an uncanny knack for getting out of the way of ranged attacks. When a ranged attack is made against the Cowboy, they can spend 1 grit point to move 5 feet as a reaction; doing so grants the Cowboy a +2 bonus to AC against the triggering attack. This movement provokes attacks of opportunity. Alternatively, the Cowboy can drop prone to gain a +4 bonus to AC against the triggering attack. The Cowboy can only perform this deed while wearing medium or light armor, and while not encumbered.<br><br>Quick Reload: As a bonus action, the Cowboy can reload a single blaster she is currently wielding. The Cowboy must have at least 1 grit point to perform this deed. Alternatively, if the Cowboy spends 1 grit point to perform this deed, they can perform quick clear as a free action.<br><br>Cowboy Spirit: As long as the Cowboy has at least 1 grit point, they gain the following benefits. First, they gain a +2 bonus on initiative checks.  Furthermore, if they have the Quick Draw feat, their hands are free and unrestrained, and the blaster is not hidden, they can draw a single ranged blaster as part of the initiative check.<br><br>Pistol-Whip: The Cowboy can make a surprise melee attack with the butt or handle of their blaster as an action. When they do, they are considered to be proficient with the blaster as a melee weapon and gains a bonus on the attack and damage rolls equal to their strength score (minimum 0). The damage dealt by the pistol-whip is of the bludgeoning type, and is determined by the size of the blaster. One-handed blasters deal 1d6 points of damage (1d4 if wielded by Small creatures) and two-handed blasters deal 1d10 points of damage (1d8 if wielded by Small creatures). If the attack hits, the Cowboy can make a strength check to knock the target prone as a free action. Performing this deed costs 1 grit point.<br><br>Cheat Death: Whenever the Cowboy is reduced to 0 or fewer hit points, they can spend all of their remaining grit points (minimum 1) to instead be reduced to 1 hit point.<br><br>Limited Casting. As a Cowboy, you are able to cast some manner of powers. You gain a 5 pool of mana.|
|RACIAL TRAITS|
|As a Human, you have the following special traits.<br><br>  <br><br>Ability Score Increase. One ability score of your choice increases by 2, and two other ability scores of your choice increase by 1. Alternatively, four ability scores of your choice each increase by 1.<br><br>  <br><br>Age. Humans reach adulthood in their late teens and live less than a century.<br><br>  <br><br>Alignment. Humans tend toward no particular alignment. The best and worst are found among them.<br><br>  <br><br>Size. Humans vary widely in height and build, from barely 5 feet to well over 6 feet tall. Regardless of your position in that range, your size is Medium.<br><br>  <br><br>Speed. Your base walking speed is 30 feet.<br><br>  <br><br>Defiant. Humans are known to be stubborn and often refuse to give up, even against the worst odds. When you or a creature you can see that can see and understand you makes an ability check, attack roll, or saving throw, you can roll a d4 and add it to their roll (no action required). Once you’ve used this feature, you must complete a short or long rest before you can use it again.<br><br>  <br><br>Human Versatility. You gain proficiency in one skill, one tool, and one weapon of your choice.<br><br>  <br><br>Languages. You can speak, read, and write Galactic Basic and one extra language of your choice. Humans typically learn the languages of other peoples they deal with, including obscure dialects. They are fond of sprinkling their speech with words borrowed from other tongues: trandoshan curses, twi’lek musical expressions, chiss military phrases, and so on.|
