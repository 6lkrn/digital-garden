Family: Yuuma is very close with all of his family, except maybe his father. His father’s absence wasn't because Yuumas father had a lack of love for his family, but his work life as a CEO of a company centered around movie production. Yuumas sisters would talk to him about everything, and he would talk to them about everything, same with his Mother. They all had such a strong bond as a family.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
Npc 1:Molly: A self proclaimed girlfriend, she talks and tries to be around Yuuma as much as she can, despite him showing little to none romantical or social interest in her.

Npc 2: Tae: Molly’s worst enemy, she too is a lot like Molly as how all she can seem to care about is Yuumas attention. She has been seen to nearly throw hands with Molly for trying to hold Yuumas hand.

Notes: Yuuma does indeed, get bitches.
