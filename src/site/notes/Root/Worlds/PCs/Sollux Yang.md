### **Sionics** 

Sollux has electricity-based telekinetic powers, known as psionics. It can be used to power things, and do other electric activities such as [CENSORED] and execution via electrocution. Fun for the whole family!

By virtue of being a telekinetic power, he can also use it to lift stuff and throw it around or whatever it is kids with telekinesis do. This ability works best when lifting metallic items, as the whole telekinesis shebang primarily works via magnetic forces in the electric currents.
