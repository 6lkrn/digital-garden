| Spark. You have enhanced cognitive processes, caused by your spark of geniality. Your access to this spark is represented by a number of spark points. You start with 10 spark points. Your spark points are used to fuel many of your features, like your Insight, detailed below. After spending a spark point, it is unavailable to you until you finish a short or a long rest. <br><br>  <br><br>Some of the features require a saving throw to resist its effects. <br><br>  <br><br>The Spark save DC equals 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier.<br><br>  <br><br>Techcasting Tool<br><br>You use a wristpad or similar machine as the tool for your tech.<br><br>  <br><br>Essential Tools. Your ability to use your spark of intelligence allows you to modify regular objects into useful gadgets. You create your gadgets during a short or a long rest, by spending 1 spark point per gadget created. Once you spend a spark point to create a gadget, you can regain that spark point until the gadget is used, and the gadget loses its effect.<br><br>  <br><br>Grappling Hook: You can forgo any attack you make as part of the Attack action to throw your grappling hook at a target within 20 feet of you. The target can be a creature, object or surface. If the target is Small or smaller, make a grapple check against it, pulling it to you and grappling it on a success. If the target is Medium or larger, you can instead pull yourself to it (no check required); this doesn’t grapple the target. Opportunity attacks provoked by this movement are made with disadvantage.<br><br>  <br><br>Airburst Mine: You create a mechanical device capable of producing a devastating blast. You can use this device to cast shatter or shockwave without expending a spell slot. Once used, this gadget can’t be used again until you finish a short or long rest, whichever comes first.<br><br>  <br><br>Sight Lenses: You create a set of lenses that would allow you see through darkness and obscurement, which you can integrate into a pair of goggles, glasses or other vision assistance. While using these lenses, you can see through fog, mist, smoke, clouds, and nonmagical darkness within 15 feet. <br><br>  <br><br>Portable Platform: You create a small floating platform that always levitates 5 ft above the ground. This Platform can carry items weighing up to 200 lb. <br><br>Projector: You can create a realistic appearing projector that can recreate a 3d image of one object or creature. This projection cannot speak and can only run a 6 second animation loop.<br><br>  <br><br>Shocking Gloves: You adapt a set of gloves to be able to charge an electric shock. Lightning springs from your hand to deliver a shock to a creature you try to touch. Make a melee attack against the target, using Int instead of Dex or Str as your attack modifier. You have advantage on the attack roll if the target is wearing armour made of metal. On a hit, the target takes 1d8 lightning damage, and it can’t take reactions until the start of its next turn.<br><br>  <br><br>Enhanced Trap: You can deploy the chosen object. The DC to avoid the effects of the object is equal to your Spark save DC, instead of the regular DC of the chosen object. In addition, you can enhance the trap with either alchemist fire or electricity, dealing additional damage equal to your spark die, of fire or lightning type, to the first creature to fail a save DC against your enhanced trap.<br><br>  <br><br>Powered Crowbar: You attach a little engine to a crowbar. You add your [Intelligence](https://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/5e_SRD:Intelligence) modifier + your spark die to the next check you make using this crowbar. You can use the crowbar a number of times equal to your [Intelligence](https://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/5e_SRD:Intelligence) modifier for each spark point you have spent on it.<br><br>  <br><br>Jet Pack: While wearing this jet pack, you can use your bonus action to activate it for 10 minutes. While active, the jet pack grants you a movement speed of 30 feet for the duration.<br><br>  <br><br>At 3rd level, you can have two gadgets built at the same time, instead of one.<br><br>  <br><br>Reconstruction. Repair a single break or tear in a mechanical object. As long as the break or tear won’t render the object unusable, you mend it, leaving no trace of the former damage. <br><br>You gain expertise in mechanics tools.<br><br>  <br><br>Improved Tinkering. You gain the ability to temporarily enhance a weapon or armour. At the end of a long rest, you can tinker with one unenhanced object that is a suit of armour, a shield, or a simple or martial weapon. Until the end of your next long rest or until you die, the object becomes an enhanced item, granting a +1 bonus to AC if it’s armour or a shield or a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls if it’s a weapon.<br><br>Once you’ve used this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest. You can add half your proficiency bonus to all checks you make with a tool you aren't already proficient with. Also, you have advantage on your Intelligence checks made to identify problems on mechanical devices or structures.<br><br>Limited Casting. As an Engineer, you are able to cast some manner of powers. You gain a 5 pool of mana. |                                                                                               |
