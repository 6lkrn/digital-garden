# Azalea March

- Azalea March was the twin brother of Lilac March, they were orphans.
    
- Azalea was fond of stars, he would usually sneak out of the orphanage to stargaze. 
    
- One day when he was stargazing a group of dark suited men came and kidnapped him.
    
- He wasn’t clear about the reason why he was kept there by his kidnappers, but while he was there he was teached a lot of skills.
    
- He eventually snuck away from his kepters and became a private investigator aimed to find his brother Lilac while trying to help others.
    
- He carries around 2 notebooks, one belonged to Lilac (He carries it around and never uses it) and the other one he uses for clues and general notes.
    
- While he worked as a private investigator, he hired an assistant Larry Waltz, who would go out on investigation jobs. (The main reason why he hired him is because Larry reminds him of Lilac.)
