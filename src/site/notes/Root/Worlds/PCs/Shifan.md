##### Shifan

  

Shifan's views of the others…so far? 

  

Felicity: OK? She's the janitor. Does her job well enough. We're both cooks so there's shifts together. I'm trying to get to her good side so she could maybe not turn me into food, at least not till I'm dead. A bond built over fire and sweat. And a lot of white powder. 

  

4CK U: What a creepy, smart ass robot. Is there any use trying to build rapport with something that could be programmed to go against you? Or would being buddy-buddy with this one eradicate that possibility? Maybe minimise it? 

  

Vlad: Fellow marine! He could use some party in his life but he's a good soldier, I guess. A bond built over fire and sweat. And a lot of blood. We're in the gunner post, gunning together for survival  victory. 

  

Lovienne: Uh. Pink people are something else, that's for sure. I wonder if I can try and get stuff from him. 

  

Shifan: This guy's alright and could use more white powder. Like, wayyyy more. A continuous supply of white powder to turn the summer coat into eternal winter! Probably not just white powder. Other stimulants could do good, too. Get them nerves away. Give them mind sharpness. That extra crisp. 

  

Shifan: This pitiable one should slow down. No amount of stimulants in this whole universe could give them control over anything. Get clean. "Getting in touch with my wild side" isn't the excuse one would want to tell others. Maybe if they're clean they can finally show everyone what they're really capable of. Maybe, if they just give themselves the chance. 

  

Shifan is a Sergeant.
