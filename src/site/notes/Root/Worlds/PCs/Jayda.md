|# FEATURES & TRAITS|
|CLASS FEATURES|
|Potent Aptitude. Your technological experience lends you an uncommon insight that you can use to bolster your allies. To do so, you use a bonus action on your turn to choose one creature other than yourself within 60 feet of you who can hear you. That creature gains one Potent Aptitude die, a d4. This die changes as you gain engineer levels, as shown in the Potent Aptitude column of the engineer table. Once within the next 10 minutes, the creature can roll the die and add the number rolled to one ability check, attack roll, or saving throw it makes. The creature can wait until after it rolls the d20 before deciding to use the Potent Aptitude die, but must decide before the GM says whether the roll succeeds or fails. Once the Potent Aptitude die is rolled, it is lost. A creature can have only one Potent Aptitude die at a time. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, as shown in the engineer table. You regain any expended uses when you finish a short or long rest.<br><br>  <br><br>Techcasting (Engineer 1st level).  During your training you have derived powers from schematics with the aid of your wrist pad. See chapter 10 for the general rules of techcasting and chapter 12 for the tech powers list.<br><br>  <br><br>Infuse Item (Engineer 2nd level). You gain the ability to temporarily enhance a weapon or armor. At the end of a long rest, you can touch one unenhanced object that is a suit of armor, a shield, or a simple or martial weapon. Until the end of your next long rest or until you die, the object becomes an enhanced item, granting a +1 bonus to AC if it’s armor or a shield or a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls if it’s a weapon. Once you’ve used this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest. This bonus increases to +2 at 10th level and +3 at 15th level. Your quick thinking and agility allow you to move and act quickly. You can take a bonus action on each of your turns in combat. This action can be used only to take the Dash, Disengage, or Hide action.<br><br>  <br><br>Tool Expertise (Engineer 2nd level). You gain expertise in any tool proficiencies you gain from this class.<br><br>  <br><br>Engineering Discipline (Engineer 3rd level). You begin to focus on a specific engineering discipline, which is detailed at the end of the class description.<br><br>  <br><br>Bonus Proficiencies. (Artificer Engineer 3rd level) You gain proficiency in artificer’s implements, and with the lightsaber simple light weapon. Additionally, when you engage in crafting with artificer’s implements, the rate at which you craft doubles<br><br>  <br><br>Modified Lightsaber (Artificer Engineer 3rd level). You learn to modify an unenhanced lightsaber utilizing your artificer knowledge. Over the course of a long rest, you can modify your lightsaber. You must have the lightsaber and artificer’s implements in order to perform this modification.<br><br>  <br><br>Your modified lightsaber is enhanced, requires attunement, can only be used by you, and counts as a tech focus for your tech powers while you are attuned to it. Your modified lightsaber has 4 modification slots, and it gains more at higher levels, as shown in the Modification Slots column of the engineer table. For each modification installed in excess of your proficiency bonus, your tech point maximum is reduced by 1. Over the course of a long rest, you can install, replace, or remove a number of modifications up to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of one).<br><br>  <br><br>Some modification effects require saving throws. When you use such an effect from this class, the DC equals your tech save DC.<br><br>  <br><br>At 9th level, you can maintain two different modified lightsabers. The total modification slots are split across the two items.<br><br>  <br>  <br><br>Force Resonance (Artificer Engineer 3rd level). Once per round, when you hit a creature with your modified lightsaber, you can expend one use of your Potent Aptitude to deal an extra 2d6 damage to that target. The damage is the same type as your modified lightsaber’s damage.<br><br>  <br><br>The damage increases when you reach certain levels in this class, increasing to 3d6 at 5th level, 5d6 at 11th level, and 8d6 at 17th level.<br><br>  <br>  <br><br>Ability Score Improvement. (Engineer 4th, 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level)<br><br>You can increase one ability score by 2, or you can increase two ability scores by 1. You can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature. (Chose Intelligence)<br><br>  <br><br>Quick Thinking (Engineer 5th level). You regain all of your expended uses of Potent Aptitude when you finish a short or long rest.|
|RACIAL TRAITS|
|Ability Score Increase. Your Intelligence score increases by 2, and your Dexterity score increases by 1.<br><br>  <br><br>Age. Much like trees, Treants are slow to mature but live a long time. They may take upwards of 100 years to reach physical and mental maturity, and can live well over 1,000 years. Some can live even up to 5,000 years, though these are rare.<br><br>  <br><br>Size.  Treants are taller than most humanoids, tending to be between 7 and 9 feet tall.<br><br>  <br><br>Speed. Your base walking speed is 30 feet.<br><br>  <br><br>Sunshine and Clean Water. If you take a short rest in sunlight, you can re-roll any Hit Dice you spend once and take the higher value. If you take a long rest next to a source of fresh water, you regain all of your Hit Dice instead of half of them.<br><br>  <br><br>Regrowth- You can be regrown from even a single twig.  Whenever you lose a limb, you are able to regrow it after a long rest.<br><br>  <br><br>Barkskin. Treefolk cannot wear armor, but their bark-like skin provides them with some natural protection. A Treefolk's Armor Class equals 10 + their Dexterity modifier + their Constitution modifier. Treefolk can use a shield and still gain this benefit. <br><br>  <br><br>Wood Vulnerabilities. You are vulnerable to fire damage. Additionally, you have disadvantage on saving throws against effects that would deal fire damage.<br><br>  <br><br>Rooted. As an action, you can spread your roots into the ground around you. You cannot move until you take an action to retract your roots. Gain advantage in all athletics checks and add +1 to your AC.  <br><br>  <br><br>Leaf Whisperer. You have the ability to communicate in a limited manner with plants. They can understand the meaning of your words, though you have no special ability to understand them in return. <br><br>Natural Fashion - You are able to create flowers, leaves and vines on your body. These parts of your body can be manipulated as long as it is on your body.<br><br>  <br><br>Languages. You can speak, read, and write Plant, Galactic Basic and one language of your choice.|
