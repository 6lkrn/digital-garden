He never knew who his parents were, all he knew was the jungle, the mountains and survival of the fittest. All his adolescent to early teenage years, he bounced around the various settlements that dotted the planet Bakura. He had became a slave 5 times, by the age of 12. However, he managed to escape enslavement every single time. This is partly because of his ingenuity and the other part is unknown to him, he can move certain objects with his mind, pull the weapons away from his captors, and even heal some of the other slaves that was with him, albeit he felt woozy after doing that but he helped them. 

The last time he escaped, he was found by a female Cathar and her crew. She helped him escape his enslavers by telling him to hide in one of the crates that they were transporting. That was his first time going to outer space, in a ship called CS Pioneer. 

Right after they jump to hyperspace, the Cathar; Nilvari Ja, sits down with him and tells him that they are a cargo ship, if he wants to travel with them. He has to earn his keep, he will be fed, have a place to sleep, have a cut also from the crew (this got a lot of whines from the others), and he'll be part of the crew until he decides to jump ship or stay on any planet he wants. He accepts this offer, and Nilvari asks what his name is. This stumps him, he never had a name. It's usually just Oi! or an assortment of numbers. Nilvari said that he looks like Caelhan. He misheard it and said his name is Kaelan. 

He travelled with the Pioneer for about a decade, during which he learned that Nilvari is a Jedi. This revelation occurred when their ship was attacked on his 2nd year anniversary on the ship. Nilvari (and Kaelan subconsciously) uses the Force to slow the ship as they are plummeting to the planet's surface. Kaelan asked her on how did she do that, she said she was once part of the Jedi Order, but was asked to leave because of a murder she didn't commit. She asked him, how did he learn to do that? Confused, he said that he can always do that. 

Nilvari then said that he is attuned to the Force and it seems that him being in Bakura made the Jedi Order miss his attunement. He asks Nilvari if he can learn from her. It took some persuading by him and the other crewmates, even unexpected by him the Jawa; Ta Same, persuaded her to teach him. When she finally succumbs to the persuasion, thus begins the most gruelling 9 years of his life (so far). 

Nilvari said she was part of the Jedi, but her training makes it seem that she is a part of the Sith. (Don’t tell her, he said that). In the 7th year of his time with the Pioneer, Nilvari gifted him two Kyber Crystals. One was bleeded and the other one somewhat pure. Nilvari's task for him was to make his own lightsaber, and when he completed it that’s the end of their training. It took him 1 and a half years to make his lightsaber and lightshoto. His training with Nilvari completed, he decides to leave the Pioneer and adventure on his own. 

He jumps from ship to ship, learning anything he can from each ship. He got better at gadgetry and tinkering. He also learned some Jawa, when he met with the Pioneer on one of his trips across the galaxy. He never went back to Bakura as it is a mess for him there, but he wishes to go back there, just to know where he actually came from. Now, he is in Tatooine searching for jobs and prospects.
