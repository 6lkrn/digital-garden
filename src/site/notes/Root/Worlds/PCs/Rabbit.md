[[Root/Campaigns/Players/Niki\|Niki]]'s character for [[12. Curse of Strahd 1\|12. Curse of Strahd 1]]

## Backstory

Rabbit was born into a family of privilege. Both her parents had received fine educations and worked tirelessly to maintain their elite status in society. Rabbit often found herself attending the frivolous events and parties her mother threw. Eventually, she had grown to detest the lifestyle that her parents had wished for her to live. 

Unknowing how to explain her frustrations to her parents, Rabbit was left with no option but to secretly rebel. Her grades at school had begun to fall and she found herself distracted by a fellow turtle named [[Root/Worlds/Barovia/NPCs/Hare\|Hare]]. Only a year to go till graduation, Rabbit was pregnant with [[Root/Worlds/Barovia/NPCs/Hare\|Hare]]’s child. 

Rabbit and [[Root/Worlds/Barovia/NPCs/Hare\|Hare]]’s families were outraged by the pregnancy and demanded for the two turtles to be married. Aware of [[Root/Worlds/Barovia/NPCs/Hare\|Hare]]’s large aspirations in life, Rabbit knew that this marriage was not the way to go. On her 16th birthday Rabbit secretly left her family home (six-months pregnant) to lead the modest life she had always wanted. 

Arriving with nothing but the clothes on her back, Rabbit took shelter at the Monastery of _. The Monastery was kind enough to offer her shelter and food in exchange for her cleaning services. Three-months later Rabbit gave birth to her daughter Bunny. For the most part, Rabbit and Bunny lived a simple and quiet life at the Monastery. Rabbit even became ordained as a nun. 

One day, Rabbit came to the realisation that the Monastery would not always be an appropriate home for herself and Bunny. Rabbit left the Monastery with Bunny in search of a new beginning.  [Rabbit and Bunny come across Black Cow Party.]
