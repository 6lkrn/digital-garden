This is an exciting tale that words are hard to find. One fine day, Lehval Aahp (Pronounced EXACTLY like “Level Up”) was mysteriously woken up by the sound of seagulls and slaps from the harsh ocean. “HALPPPPPP HALPPPPP!” shouted Lehval as he realised he was in the middle of the freaking ocean and he can’t swim. You see, just a year and half ago, a plague called COBID19 forced citizens to remain indoors. Lehval was almost bored till death until he found a new found hobby - WERKOUT! Since then, he fell in love with PROTEINZ and GAINZ and of course, his wonderful self. *charming hair flick with a very (not) subtle flex of his muscular body* Ok back to the story, Lehval is BUFF but he can’t swim.

Thankfully, a kind fisherman (?)  (INSERT NPC CAPTAIN’S NAME) heard his very manly cry and saved him. To repay his kindness, Lehval offered to work on the ship. 

The End….

Like almost every other hero, Lehval has a secret. When he was 10 years old, his father left to find the treasure but he never came back. He says he will never forget him for leaving the family behind, and will trace his footsteps to find the treasure in hope to find his long-lost father. It’s a secret because he doesn’t like to talk about his family and fweelingz because Lehval is a strong man who won’t allow others to take advantage of his soft heart. (He was conned too many times believing strangers’ words of sighting of his father)
