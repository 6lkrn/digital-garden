[Mo](Mo.md)'s character for [[12. Curse of Strahd 1\|12. Curse of Strahd 1]] 

## Backstory

Wayhand Deepmaul was born in a cave… the Cave was a hospital located in the town of Alfredia, a mining rich town located along the coastal mountain range.Wayhand belongs to a clan called The Alderfists the Excessive demand and trade for the rare jewels hidden within the mountain ranges around provided protection against any land invasions. Wayhand was brought up in the middle upper class of the mining crew. He worked with fine gems and high quality metals such as gold and platinum. This made him fast and agile with his hands. Like all the dwarves of the Alderfists clan, he was trained to be a member of the Guild of the Shields which, contrary to the name, was charged with the safety of the city of Alfredia.. This helped him train his hand to hand combat. To others it seems he was well off and satisfied with the positions he was in. He did not have to work in the dusty dirty mines of the tourmaline, coal and quartz. But on the inside he was hollow.

Devoid of any feeling of satisfaction, he continued his work but these deep, dark and dusty mines fascinated him and pulled him towards them. The work he did gave him money but no satisfaction. His family forbade him from ever following his whims and dreams. Through his early years he was able to resist these urges but as he got to his later years the put kept getting stronger and stronger. On the night of the second day of November (or whatever the 2nd last month of the year is), the pull was so strong he could no longer contain it. During the dead of the night we ventured down one of the many Tourmaline with no direction in mind with only the pull dragging him to his destination.  

As he got closer the voice of a goddess whispered in his ear and called out to him and guided him to a portion of the main main shaft, an area which the miner had driven past many times. And he began to dig into it and continued for about hours into the night. When he broke into a hidden geode of Spinel. Such a vast geode he had never heard of or seen before ever in his life. A glimmer caught his eye as he was sucked into the astral realm. Here he met Arawn the god of life and death. For an unknown reason, Wayhand was chosen to be the holder of some of his cosmic knowledge and how he can bend the astral realm to his will to create these arms of power around him. He also tasked him with being the sword of the mortal world where his first task would be to venture with a group into Barovia to investigate and render the balance between life and death to the region as something is not right. The encounter lasted maybe a couple of minutes but to Wayhand it felt hours or days of time had passed.  

When he came out of his trance-like state he immediately left the city. To date the city thinks of him as lost to the mountains with the Clan Leader and Guild of Shields shunning him for his cowardice. Wayhnad has moved on and expanded to other things lesser to the cities knowledge
