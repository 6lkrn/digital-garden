-   The Mages' Arrival
    
    -   At one point, a little over a thousand years ago, a great circle of mages wondered into the valley. These mages had dedicated their lives to studying, understanding, and defeating great evils of a magical nature. In their studies, they discovered the [[Root/Worlds/Barovia/Factions/Dark Powers\|Dark Powers]] and hoped to somehow subdue the evil gods.
        
    -   The mages were looking for a place to found a base for their research. Not only was the valley beautiful and rich in [[Magic\|Magic]], it was also remote, flanked by impassable mountains. These mages went on to build the [[Root/Worlds/Barovia/Locations/Amber Temple\|Amber Temple]] on [[Root/Worlds/Barovia/Locations/Mount Ghakis\|Mount Ghakis]], and subsequently all died at the hands of their own good intentions.
        
    -   However, the coming of the mages also lead to a sort of industrial boom for the settlements of the valley. The villages grew in population and became much more civilized.
