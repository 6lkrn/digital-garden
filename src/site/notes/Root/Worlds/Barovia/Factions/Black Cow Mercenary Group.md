How the party met one another:

Raleigh was going through a town called Wildacre, and was asked by the locals to corral a stampede of cows. If they were normal cows, the townsfolk wouldn't mind but these were Corinthian Cows, aggressive and vicious. Also some said they eat flesh.

The town’s head offered a sum of money to whomever that had the gumption to either lead the impending stampede away from the town or if worse comes to worse, slaughter all of the cows. 

Raleigh took this offer and with him, there were several other idiots that were willing to risk their lives either for the money, saving the town or just the meat of the cows. (Raleigh was in for all three). 

He met the other idiots; the pale elf paladin; Mayari (Maya), the out of sorts duergar monk; Wayhand (Hansy), the clever gnome wizard; Farwyn (Wyn), the neurotic aasimar cleric; Aurelis (Relic) and the airheaded human druid, Wrelen (Wren) at the town’s gate and together they went trekking about 10 miles out to the pasture where the cows were.

All in all, it took killing some of the cows before they retreated back to whence they came. However, it wasn't before they fought the alpha cow. A big black corinthian bull, it stands around the same height as Raleigh if not taller. Its eyes were red and its horns sharp and stained with blood. 

Raleigh was almost skewered by the bull, if not for Maya's help. He pledged an undying loyalty to Maya if she ever needed anything he would do it (to a certain extent). 

Raleigh, almost dying, sat down and opted out of fighting in order to get healed a bit by Relic. He was preparing to go and help Maya and Hansy but it turns out they didn't need him. He heard Maya shout loudly as if challenging the bull to focus on her, banging on her shield and as the bull's attention was on Maya, he saw Hansy with four arms, two of which looked to be ethereal and purple in colour, and he punched the bull rapidly and the bull slowly fell onto its side. Dead of internal bleeding. 

The aftermath of the battle, since Raleigh was the only strong enough to carry the bull's head (proof of completion). They head back towards the town and a feast was held by the townsfolk in honour of the Black Cows, it was the townsfolk's idea to name the party. 

The party decided to continue adventuring together for a bit since more people means better chances of surviving.


Next Town: Dragonhelm

After a bit of travelling from Wildacre, the party ended up in Dragonhelm. A port city, with a population of about roughly 5,000 citizens. The party decided to stay here for a bit since some of the party members had some errands to do around the city. 

During their stay, they made some waves doing odd jobs and what not. Their party name got
