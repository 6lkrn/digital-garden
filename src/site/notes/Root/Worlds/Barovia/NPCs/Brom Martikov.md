_Wereraven, Youngest son of Urwin and Danika_

###### Description:

About 9 years old, short dark hair and annoying childlike attitude. Asks a lot of questions.

###### Bio:

Brom is the younger son of [Urwin](https://strahdsbod.obsidianportal.com/characters/urwin-martikov) and [Danika Martikov](https://strahdsbod.obsidianportal.com/characters/danika-martikov), and lived with them and his elder brother [Bray](https://strahdsbod.obsidianportal.com/characters/bray-martikov) in the [Blue Water Inn](https://strahdsbod.obsidianportal.com/wikis/blue-water-inn) in [Vallaki](https://strahdsbod.obsidianportal.com/wikis/vallaki).

After the death of his brother and father, Brom continues to live with his mother in the [Dancing Crow Inn](https://strahdsbod.obsidianportal.com/wikis/dancing-crow-inn). He is still quite young, and time will tell how he deals with the great loss of his family members.
