# **ROLEPLAYING THE ABBOT:**


# **DM Notes:**

- The Abbot hasn't been seen in 40 years. Instead of the weird animal-people he was experimenting on, I've been having him make a lot of flesh golems. The Abbot is the angel of St. Cuthbert who sent him to help free the soul of Ireena upon hearing [[Root/Worlds/Barovia/NPCs/Sergei von Zarovich\|Sergei]]'s continuous prayers. After rending open a hole to get her soul out of Barovia, it sucked up a lot of extra souls as well, creating a shortage and the emergence of the Shells (bodies without souls). The Abbot went mad trying to fill the shells with souls (hence the stillborn sister appearing in Barovia) and got his wires crossed, making new shells, i.e. flesh golems with the hope that the souls would comeback and need bodies.

- Having to animate the golems, he gave a bit of his own soul in each one to make them move, leaving the Abbot mad and stumbling around calling for St Cuthbert by only mumbling "My God..." over and over. Giving up his soul to the flesh golems, some of them have powers and personalities they shouldn't. I'm giving Toll the Dead and Sacred Flame to them to be able to cast at the PCs. One of them got the Abbot's passion for music and is wandering the grounds of the Abbey with a saxophone playing smooth jazz.

- I intend for them to beat the flesh golems and restore the Abbot, giving his mind back to him and his goodness. I'd like the Abbey to be a refuge for them for the rest of the campaign, but I'm feeling they will never fully be comfortable anywhere as the trauma from Vallaki and Barovia, as well as Old Bonegrinder and Yester Hill was just the right recipe.
