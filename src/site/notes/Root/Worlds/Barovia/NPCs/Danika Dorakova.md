###### Bio:

Danika Martikov is a wereraven innkeeper. Her husband, [Urwin Martikov](https://strahdsbod.obsidianportal.com/characters/urwin-martikov), and elder son [Bray](https://strahdsbod.obsidianportal.com/characters/bray-martikov) were killed in the fire which destroyed their former inn, the [Blue Water Inn](https://strahdsbod.obsidianportal.com/wikis/blue-water-inn), during the [Festival of the Blazing Sun](https://strahdsbod.obsidianportal.com/wikis/festival-of-the-blazing-sun). She and her younger son [Brom](https://strahdsbod.obsidianportal.com/characters/brom-martikov) operate a new inn called the [Dancing Crow Inn](https://strahdsbod.obsidianportal.com/wikis/dancing-crow-inn).

Danika and her family are key members of the [Keepers of the Feather](https://strahdsbod.obsidianportal.com/wikis/keepers-of-the-feather). When our heroes arrived in [Vallaki](https://strahdsbod.obsidianportal.com/wikis/vallaki) she and her husband sheltered both [Ismark Kolyanovich](https://strahdsbod.obsidianportal.com/characters/ismark-kolyanovich) and [Ireena Kolyana](https://strahdsbod.obsidianportal.com/characters/ireena-kolyana) in the Blue Water Inn. During the Festival of the Blazing Sun, the inn was burned down, and Urwin, Bray and Ismark were all killed.

As recompense, our heroes gifted the now vacant [Wachterhaus](https://strahdsbod.obsidianportal.com/wikis/wachterhaus) to Danika, who turned it into the [Dancing Crow Inn](https://strahdsbod.obsidianportal.com/wikis/dancing-crow-inn). She continues to shelter our heroes when they are in Vallaki, but she is more focused on running her inn and raising her surviving son than helping the fight against [Strahd von Zarovich](https://strahdsbod.obsidianportal.com/characters/strahd-von-zarovich).
