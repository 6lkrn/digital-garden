**Katarina "Katya" Martikov** is a [[Wereraven\|Wereraven]]  and a member of the [[Root/Worlds/Barovia/Factions/Keepers of the Feather\|Keepers of the Feather]]. A young adult, Katya is not yet married, and lives with her father [[Root/Worlds/Barovia/NPCs/Adrian Martikov\|Adrian Martikov]] at the [[Root/Worlds/Barovia/Locations/Wizard of Wines\|Wizard of Wines]] winery. Kat is a bold adventurer and fighter. She is an active member of the rebel Movement, helping on many missions around the valley.

Katya's mother, [[Root/Worlds/Barovia/NPCs/Muriel Martikov\|Muriel Martikov]], was presumed to be dead for years, but was recently discovered to have been imprisoned by [[Root/Worlds/Barovia/NPCs/Baba Lysaga\|Baba Lysaga]]  in her creeping hut.

When the party asks about the dangers of [[Root/Worlds/Barovia/Locations/Berez\|Berez]] , Katya volunteered that Baba Lysaga lived there. She then recited a poem, with Ireena joining in:

> _She takes little girls and bathes in their blood,_
> _She takes little boys who don’t do as they should._
> _She lives in a house that walks on two legs,_
> _She keeps many toads that sit on hen eggs._
> _In the skull of a giant, she flies through the air,_
> _She comes for bad children, so you better beware._
