In many campaigns, there is a place or a person to go to--or at least should go to--to ask for clues to get unstuck. In this campaign, there are several of them out there, providing much needed lore for a price. None of them would be bigger than “[[Old Gnawbones\|Old Gnawbones]].” Staring Twilight (dragonspeak for Terminal Old Age) in the face, she takes solace in ensuring that the egg she's nurturing will take over her hoard. Which contains of thousands of [[Scrying\|Scrying]] crystals form which she can see practically everything that happens in the Savage North. If you want someone to be more observant of the world, you have to go to [[Root/Worlds/Barovia/Locations/Barovia\|Barovia]] and meet Count Strahd.

Because of her knowledge, she has become quite an asset for the [[Root/Worlds/Faerun/Factions/Harpers\|Harpers]], especially in recent years thanks to Gnawbone's old age. In fact, her tendency to hoard information as much as gold is part of her role in the setting.

Claugiyimatar will offer any needed bit on a one by one basis with an ever-increasing price of an addition to her hoard, starting at 100 GP and doubling for each successive question asked. She'll answer each question as much as she can that can push the adventure forward but no more.

*Storm King’s Thunder* suggests a modified stat block for Claugiyimatar, so I’m including that here.

If Claugiyliamatar is found in her lair at Kryptgarden Fores, her lair actions are active.
