# **Rundown:**

Mongrelfolk  
[[Root/Worlds/Barovia/NPCs/The Abbot\|The Abbot]]'s gravedigger
 

# **Description:**
[[Root/Worlds/Barovia/NPCs/Otto Belview\|Otto Belview]]. Otto is 4 feet, 9 inches tall and squats instead of standing upright. He looks like a beardless dwarf with patches of donkey flesh covering his face and body. He has one human ear and one wolf's ear, and a protruding wolf's snout and fangs. His arms and hands are human, but his legs and feet are leonine, and he has a donkey's tail. He can barely speak Common, and his laugh sounds like a donkey's bray. He wears a plain wool cloak.

Otto has the Standing Leap feature (see the mongrelfolk stat block in appendix D). His madness is embodied in the following statement: "I am the smartest, wisest, strongest, fastest, and most beautiful person I know." [[Root/Worlds/Barovia/NPCs/Zygfrek Belview\|Zygfrek Belview]]. [[Root/Worlds/Barovia/NPCs/Zygfrek Belview\|Zygfrek]] stands 4 feet, 7 inches tall. The left side of her face and body is covered with Uzard 
scales, the right with tufts of gray wolf fur. Between these tufts is pale human skin. One of her eyes is that of a feline, and her fingers and hands resemble cat's paws with opposable thumbs. She has a gruff voice and wears a gray cloak with black fur trim.
