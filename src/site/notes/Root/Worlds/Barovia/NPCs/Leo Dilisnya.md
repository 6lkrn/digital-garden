Leo was one of the soldiers who betrayed and murdered Strahd on the day of [[Root/Worlds/Barovia/NPCs/Sergei von Zarovich\|Sergei]] and [[Root/Worlds/Barovia/NPCs/Tatyana Ivanova\|Tatyana Ivanova]]'s wedding. He escaped from [[Root/Worlds/Barovia/Locations/Castle Ravenloft\|Castle Ravenloft]], only to be hunted down and killed by the vampire [[Root/Worlds/Barovia/NPCs/Strahd von Zarovich\|Strahd]]. The Wachters keep his bones under lock and key so that Leo can't be raised from the dead.
