# **Character History:**
During the earlier years of Strahd's rule, there was a peasant born in Berez named Marina.
The vampire Strahd first met Marina in this small village on the shore of the Luna River. Marina bore a striking resemblance to Strahd's beloved Tatyana, both in appearance and manner, and she became Strahd's obsession. 

He seduced her in the dead of night and feasted on her blood, but before she could be turned into a vampire, the burgomaster of [[Root/Worlds/Barovia/Locations/Berez\|Berez]], [[Lazio Ulrich\|Lazio Ulrich]], with the aid of a local priest named [[Root/Worlds/Barovia/NPCs/Brother Grigor\|Brother Grigor]], killed [[Root/Worlds/Barovia/NPCs/Marina\|Marina]] to save her soul from damnation.
Enraged, Strahd slew the priest and the burgomaster, then used his power over the land to swell the river, flooding the village and the residents, killing everyone.

Marina now haunts these ruins, driven mad by her cursed immortal life. She sacrifices living creatures and experiments on scarecrows in an insane effort to resurrect her people. A hermit, she spends most of her time hunting down and kill the ravens and the wereravens that infest Strahd's domain. When she isn't working evil magic, Baba Lysaga sacrifices beasts to the dark powers and collects their blood, then bathes in the blood on nights of the new moon in a ritual to satisfy the dark powers and gain more power herself.

[[Root/Worlds/Barovia/NPCs/Marina\|Marina]] recently stole [[Root/Resources/Equipment/Magic Items/Stone of Life\|Stone of Life]] from the [[Root/Worlds/Barovia/Locations/Wizard of Wines Winery\|Wizard of Wines Winery]]vineyard (chapter 12), in the hope that the stone can create life. The gem has given her hut a semblance of life.

Strahd had a monument erected after Marina's death. The monument is hidden up the marsh, and the characters aren't likely to find it on their own unless they scour the area thoroughly. If they lay Burgomaster Ulrich's spirit to rest (see area U2), it points them to this location before fading away.

The following boxed text assumes that the characters have met [[Root/Worlds/Barovia/NPCs/Ireena Kolyana\|Ireena Kolyana]]. If they have not, don't read the
sentence that mentions her.

>Hidden by the fog and elevated a few feet above the surrounding marsh is a raised plot of land, barely ten feet on a side, enclosed by a disintegrating iron fence. In the center of the plot is a life-sized stone monument carved in the likeness of a kneeling peasant girl clutching a rose. 
>Although her features are gray and weatherworn, she bears a striking resemblance to lreena Kolyana. Carved 
>into the monument's base is an epitaph.

> The epitaph reads as follows: Marina, Taken by the Night.

# **DM Notes:**

-   Dead and reincarnated by the dark powers. Powerful witch that is intent on destroying Strahd. She thinks the [[Root/Resources/Equipment/Magic Items/Stone of Life\|Stone of Life]] can bring back her village and her family.
