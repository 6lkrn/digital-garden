See: [[Root/Worlds/Barovia/Locations/Svalich Woods\|Svalich Woods]] Introduction

The dead man, [[Root/Worlds/Barovia/NPCs/Dalvan Olensky\|Dalvan Olensky]], was trying to escape from Barovia with a letter from his master when he was killed on the road by Strahd's dire wolves. Wanting to return at once to Strahd, the wolves left the body in the woods but have not yet returned to feast.

The letter in Dalman's hand has a large "B" set into its wax seal. The parchment is worn and flimsy. If the characters open and read the letter, show the players "[[Kolyan Indirovich's Letter\|Kolyan Indirovich's Letter]]" in appendix F. The letter is dated one week ago.
Dalvan was instructed to place the letter at the gates, in the hope that visitors would find it and turn back.
