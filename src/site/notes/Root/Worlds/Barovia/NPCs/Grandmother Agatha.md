She is a Green Hag who lives in [[Root/Worlds/Faerun/Locations/Conyberry\|Conyberry]], using the same name as the Banshee she's replacing in *Lost Mine of Phandelver.* While on the outside she's still a typical Hag in both image and temperament, she does have a warm and tender spot in her heart for the children she adopted into her coven. She tends to the children quite well while she guides them into her craft. Because of this, she's Chaotic Good, and isn't as ugly as expected unless she alters her form for effect. (She resembles Elphaba from *Wicked* more than a traditional Hag.) Her deals tend to be more prankish and embarrassing then corrupting.


She uses the same hint mechanic as with Dragons, demanding an increasing price for each individual tip. It starts at a value of 100 GP and doubles with each sequential tip.

When I design her character sheet, I'll use the Witch class I incorporated into Æthercoil, and listed in Æthercoil Magazine.

Background: Hag

Due to your actions or upbringing with your magic, darkness is starting to embrace you, changing you into their form. Whatever or not you were forced to do so or didn't see any other way, or you just plain dived head first into darkness's embrace, it has changed you into a hag form. It shows in your physical form, your tone of voice, the claws in your warty hands, the way you even carry yourself, the shroud of Darkness is part of you, and you do not know if you wish to resist it and find a way to redemption, or give in and see how deep you can fall and still consider yourself a person.

Background Feature: Dark Magic

 

Being a Hag doesn't make you much compatible in civilization. In fact, you prefer to shun the public and live alone with your thoughts, your collection, and your magic. As your actions turned you into a hag, the general public is fearful and even antagonistic toward you, and sometimes even hostile. However, the darkness within you has also given you some added feature
