# **Description:**
 

# **Character History:**
**Davian Martikov** is a Barovian wereraven. He and his sister [[Root/Worlds/Barovia/NPCs/Elsa Martikov\|Elsa Martikov]] are the current leaders of the [[Root/Worlds/Barovia/Factions/Keepers of the Feather\|Keepers of the Feather]].

Davian has four children. His wife, [[Root/Worlds/Barovia/NPCs/Alma Martikov\|Alma Martikov]], died when Elvir was an infant. Davian's three eldest children have all married, and he has five grandchildren.

At some point in the past, Davian had a falling out with his second-eldest son, Urwin. This resulted in Urwin moving to [[Root/Worlds/Barovia/Locations/Vallaki\|Vallaki]] with his wife, [[Root/Worlds/Barovia/NPCs/Danika Dorakova\|Danika Dorakova]], to take over management of Danika's father's inn [[Root/Worlds/Barovia/Locations/Blue Water Inn\|Blue Water Inn]].

Elsa Martikov helped the party escape through a series of secret tunnels while Davian, Stefania, and [Dag](https://alberons-mistake.fandom.com/wiki/Dag_Tomescu "Dag Tomescu") looked after the children. Shortly thereafter, [Strahd](https://alberons-mistake.fandom.com/wiki/Strahd_von_Zarovich "Strahd von Zarovich") had [Vanargand](https://alberons-mistake.fandom.com/wiki/Vanargand "Vanargand") and his werewolves burn the winery to the ground. Davian and most of his children and grandchildren are missing and presumed dead after this incident.

Davian is an old and suspicious man. Davian and the rest of the [[Root/Worlds/Barovia/Factions/Keepers of the Feather\|Keepers of the Feather]] supply the cities of [[Root/Worlds/Barovia/Locations/Krezk\|Krezk]] and [[Root/Worlds/Barovia/Locations/Vallaki\|Vallaki]] with their special brand of magically-brewed wine, in order to provide some form of happiness to the people of [[Root/Worlds/Barovia/Locations/Barovia\|Barovia]].
