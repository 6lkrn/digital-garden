# **Rundown:**

-   Mongrelfolk

-   [[Root/Worlds/Barovia/NPCs/The Abbot\|The Abbot]]'s faithful, two-headed manservant

-   Rings the abbey's bell (area S17) when the Abbot decides it's time for dinner.

-   The larger head does all the talking. The smaller head has a forked snake's tongue and can't do anything except hiss and make other horrible sounds.
