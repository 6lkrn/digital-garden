**Jeny Greenteeth**

| **d20** | **Task**|
|----|-----|
| 1  | Give Jeny a lingering embrace|
| 2  | Allow Jeny to dig out one ounce of ear wax from your ear with only her finger. She is clearly saving it for something...|
| 3  | Bring Jeny thirteen strands of your hair; every strand must be exactly the length of your thumb.|
| 4 | Tell Jeny your deepest, darkest fear. You instinctively understand that she will know if you are lying, and that dismissing this as a laughable matter will enrage her!|
| 5 | Allow Jeny to trim your toenails with her teeth.|
| 6 | Give Jeny exactly one ounce of your skin. You can choose where on your body she peels it from.|
| 7 | Grant Jeny a stein full of your still-warm saliva. If it cools, you’ll have to collect it again.|
| 8 | Maintain direct and unblinking eye contact with Jeny for no less than one minute. Neither of you is allowed to speak. At the end of this time, you must succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or have Jeny scream so loudly that you begin your next adventure deafened. This condition lasts until you finish a long rest.|
| 9 | Convince your three closest allies to donate one drop of blood each to Jeny’s “friendship muffin” recipe. If they refuse, you must pay the full cost of the spell.|
| 10| Build a bonfire and burn the large wicker [[Human\|Human]] effigy near Jeny’s yurt. She assures you there’s nothing wrong. Don’t mind the screaming. . .|
| 11 | Bite the burgomaster’s finger, then make a successful DC 15 Strength (Athletics) check to run away. If you fail, spend 10 [[Campaign Resources/Rules/One Piece 5e/DM Screen/General Rules/DM Screen/Downtime\|Campaign Resources/Rules/One Piece 5e/DM Screen/General Rules/DM Screen/Downtime]] days in jail or pay a 20 gp fine.|
| 12 | Bring the village execution to Jeny’s hut for “tea time.” You must succeed on a DC 15 Charisma (Persuasion) check to convince him it was all her fault and not yours. If you fail, spend 10 [[Campaign Resources/Rules/One Piece 5e/DM Screen/General Rules/DM Screen/Downtime\|Campaign Resources/Rules/One Piece 5e/DM Screen/General Rules/DM Screen/Downtime]] days in jail or pay a 20 gp fine.|
| 13 | Praise the tax collector for his frugal and sensible tactics. You must succeed on a DC 15 Charisma (Deception) check to avoid his ire or suspicion. If you fail, spend 10 [[Campaign Resources/Rules/One Piece 5e/DM Screen/General Rules/DM Screen/Downtime\|Campaign Resources/Rules/One Piece 5e/DM Screen/General Rules/DM Screen/Downtime]] days in jail or pay a 20 gp fine.|
| 14 | Recover three “puppy” hairs from Gregori’s shop, the [[Root/Worlds/Barovia/NPCs/Hare\|Hare]] & Hair.|
| 15 | Bring Jeny a small white puppy, a large brown [[Cat\|Cat]], and an aged rooster for use as spell components. All three animals must be alive when you hand them over.|
| 16 | Allow Jeny to dye your hair with a color of her choosing; this new color is permanent.|
| 17 | Eat eleven of Jeny’s cantaloupe-and-venison no-bake cookies, and be sure to clean up all the crumbs! You begin your next adventure with the poisoned condition.|
| 18 | You must promise to communicate exclusively through dance (no verbalizing allowed) during your next adventure. This does not prevent you from using verbal components to cast your spells, nor does it prevent you from using your bardic abilities. If you break this promise, you fall unconscious immediately, and any condition that Jeny’s spellcasting removed from you is reapplied with no saving throw permitted. At the start of each of your turns, you can attempt a DC 15 Charisma saving throw, regaining consciousness on a success.|
| 19 | Allow Jeny to remove your thumbnails with her favorite hammer. You begin your next game with one level of exhaustion.|
| 20 | Describe your family tree to Jeny. You must go back at least three generations. For those relatives still alive, she demands detailed descriptions of their likenesses and where they live. |

## [[Campaign Resources/Magic/Spellcasting Services\|Campaign Resources/Magic/Spellcasting Services]] from Jeny Greenteeth

The hag Jeny Greenteeth (whom some characters might remember from adventure DDEX1-8: Tales Trees Tell) has taken up residence in Strahd’s realm of [[Root/Worlds/Barovia/Locations/Barovia\|Barovia]]. She finds the Domain of Dread to her liking, and she especially enjoys being the only spellcaster in Strahd’s realm willing to sell her services—and thus being able to force characters to do favors for her. In order to purchase a spell from Jeny, a character pays a cost in gold plus a number of [[Campaign Resources/Rules/One Piece 5e/DM Screen/General Rules/DM Screen/Downtime\|Campaign Resources/Rules/One Piece 5e/DM Screen/General Rules/DM Screen/Downtime]] days. [[Campaign Resources/Rules/One Piece 5e/DM Screen/General Rules/DM Screen/Downtime\|Campaign Resources/Rules/One Piece 5e/DM Screen/General Rules/DM Screen/Downtime]] days spent in this manner do not reflect actual time passing (and do not require an additional gold piece or lifestyle payment). Instead, they reflect on a certain amount of wear and tear inflicted on a character’s body and soul. 

Jeny is willing to forgive the [[Campaign Resources/Rules/One Piece 5e/DM Screen/General Rules/DM Screen/Downtime\|Campaign Resources/Rules/One Piece 5e/DM Screen/General Rules/DM Screen/Downtime]] requirement for her spells if you agree to one of her [[Campaign Resources/Rules/5e/Combat/Conditions\|Campaign Resources/Rules/5e/Combat/Conditions]]. Once you have agreed to a condition, it cannot be taken back, undone, or done again. She accepts these gifts only once (so reroll if you roll a previously completed task). Jeny casts only one discounted spell for a character per adventure, regardless of whether that character paid the alternative [[Campaign Resources/Rules/One Piece 5e/DM Screen/General Rules/DM Screen/Downtime\|Campaign Resources/Rules/One Piece 5e/DM Screen/General Rules/DM Screen/Downtime]] cost or not. She does not offer this discount to characters who have the “Traded with a Hag” story reward (from adventure DDEX1-12: Raiders of the Twilight Marsh) or the “Swore an Oath to King Witchthorn” story reward (from adventure DDEP1-1: Corruption in Kryptgarden).

* Alternatively, a character can pay 250 gp + 150 DT and take a side effect, as if the character had been raised by the **[[Root/Worlds/Barovia/Factions/Dark Powers\|Dark Powers]]**.

To determine Jeny Greenteeth’s alternative [[Campaign Resources/Rules/One Piece 5e/DM Screen/General Rules/DM Screen/Downtime\|Campaign Resources/Rules/One Piece 5e/DM Screen/General Rules/DM Screen/Downtime]] costs, the DM rolls a d20 and consults the following table, or can choose a task. All tasks should be noted on your logsheet. Previously completed tasks cannot be repeated.
