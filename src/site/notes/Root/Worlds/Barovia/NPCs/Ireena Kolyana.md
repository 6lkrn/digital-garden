ROLE PLAYING !REENA

[[Root/Worlds/Barovia/NPCs/Ireena Kolyana\|Ireena]], a striking young woman with auburn hair, has been bitten twice by [[Root/Worlds/Barovia/NPCs/Strahd von Zarovich\|Strahd]]. The villagers are afraid of  her and avoid her. The characters are [[Root/Worlds/Barovia/NPCs/Ireena Kolyana\|Ireena]]'s best hope for protection, so she is willing to accompany them under certain conditions. Although she appears mild, she has a strong will, and she aids the party as best she can in saving herself. She doesn't remember her early past. She doesn't know how she came to [[Root/Worlds/Barovia/Locations/Barovia\|Barovia]] or where she came from. Moreover, her encounters with [[Root/Worlds/Barovia/NPCs/Strahd von Zarovich\|Strahd]] are fuzzy memories, thanks to his vampiric charm, but she can recall clearly the blazing hunger in his eyes. 

She tells the characters that wolves and other terrible creatures attacked the house night after night for weeks. The burgomaster's heart couldn't stand the constant assault, and he died three days ago. Strangely, since his death, the house has not come under attack. She says that no one from the village has been brave enough to help [[Root/Worlds/Barovia/NPCs/Ismark Kolyanovich\|Ismark]] take [[Root/Worlds/Barovia/NPCs/Kolyan Indirovich\|Kolyan Indirovich]] to the cemetery for proper burial. [[Root/Worlds/Barovia/NPCs/Ireena Kolyana\|Ireena]] asks the characters if they would be so kind as to help [[Root/Worlds/Barovia/NPCs/Ismark Kolyanovich\|Ismark]] deliver her father's body safely to [[Root/Worlds/Barovia/NPCs/Donavich\|Donavich]], the local priest (area ES). She refuses to be taken to [[Root/Worlds/Barovia/Locations/Vallaki\|Vallaki]] or anywhere else while the burgomaster lies dead on the mansion floor.

 
**Profile: Ireena Kolyana** 

Roleplaying Information 

Resonance. Ireena should inspire flattery with her genuine interest in the players' goals and interests, sympathy for her sense of guilt and fear of Strahd, endearment for her determination to continue moving forward, and gratitude for her efforts to help the players succeed. 

Emotions. Ireena most often feels curious, thoughtful, melancholy, guilty, stubborn, joyful, determined, defiant, and anxious. 

Motivations. Ireena wants to keep her fellow Barovians and Ismark safe, honor her parents' memory, learn new stories, and one day explore distant lands. 

Inspirations. When playing Ireena, channel Belle (Beauty and the Beast), Elizabeth Swann (Pirates of the Caribbean), Eowyn (Lord of the Rings), Hermione Granger (Harry Potter) and Katniss Everdeen (The Hunger Games). 

Character Information 

Persona. To the world, Ireena is a compassionate, curious, yet stubborn young noblewoman. To those she trusts, Ireena is an anxious, yet determined young woman who dreams of freedom and adventure. Deep down, Ireena wonders whether giving herself up to Strahd would be the best way to protect those she loves. 

Morale. In a fight, Ireena will always turn to words before a sword. If necessary to defend herself, though, she'll draw her rapier—reluctantly, if protecting herself, and proudly, if protecting another. 

Relationships. Ireena is the (knowing) adopted sister of Ismark Kolyanovich, the (unknowing) sister of [[Root/Worlds/Barovia/NPCs/Izek Strazni\|Izek Strazni]], and the (unknowing) reincarnation of Tatyana. 

Ismark then asks the players if they will assist him in transporting their father’s remains to the local church shortly before daybreak the following morning, so that he can be buried at dawn before they depart. (Ireena will not willingly leave Barovia before this is done.) If they agree, Ireena and Ismark are both vocally grateful. 

Settling In 

Ismark soon departs to gather a search party to locate [[Root/Worlds/Barovia/NPCs/Gertruda\|Gertruda]]—one that he clearly fears will be in vain. As he does, Ireena offers to help the players get settled in, setting them up in the mansion's two guest bedrooms and providing them with basic supplies. 

If the players are looking to purchase additional supplies, Ireena offers them directions to [[Root/Worlds/Barovia/NPCs/Bildrath Cantemir\|Bildrath]]’s Mercantile, but warns them not to mention Ismark's name. If the players ask her why Ismark is called "the Lesser," Ireena winces, and can share the following information: 

When Strahd's dusk elf servant—a cruel-looking man named [[Root/Worlds/Barovia/NPCs/Rahadin\|Rahadin]]—delivered his warning three months ago, many Barovians were prepared to flee the village for Vallaki. 

Ismark, however, delivered a thundering and inspiring speech, invoking the memory of Lugdana and [[Root/Worlds/Barovia/NPCs/Ismark the Great\|Ismark the Great]] to encourage them to stay and fight for their homes. Most did so. 

In the aftermath of Strahd's siege, many who had lost homes or loved ones in the battle blamed Ismark, who they felt had led them astray with his foolish fantasies of heroism and valor. They now call him "Ismark the Lesser" in mockery of his ancestry. 

No one feels more guilty or ashamed than Ismark himself, who has taken the weight of every death incurred in the siege on his own shoulders—and the weight of the rebuilding that followed. 

If the players ask about their parents, Ireena freely shares the following information while asking after the players' own families: 

Ismark and Ireena's parents were [[Root/Worlds/Barovia/NPCs/Kolyan Indirovich\|Kolyan Indirovich]] and Korina Targolova. Korina died of a sickness fourteen years ago, but Kolyan has done his best since then to continue raising both children alone. (The scarf Ireena wears is her last memory of her mother.) 

Kolyan, their father, was the one who found Ireena when she was a young girl, by the edge of the Svalich Woods near the Pillarstone of Ravenloft. Ireena doesn't remember anything of her past before then, but is grateful to her parents for taking her in and loving her dearly. 

A few hours later, dusk arrives over Barovia. Ismark returns, weary and somber, but carrying a small bag in his hands. He joins Ireena to prepare a meal for the players: a stew of turnips and rabbit-meat, plus a somewhat stale loaf of bread. Ismark apologizes for the sparse meal, but the players can clearly see that the siblings' pantry is nearly bare, and can surmise that Ismark purchased the rabbit while out. 

Over dinner, Ismark and Ireena ask the players about their interests and lives outside of Barovia. Ireena especially is fascinated by tales of the world beyond the mists. When the meal has finished, Ismark and Ireena retire to bed, leaving the players to their own devices.

However, Kolyan’s corpse still bears the wounds that killed him: a deep gash on his forehead, and multiple lacerations across his chest. 

Additionally, Ireena wears a thick red scarf to cover the marks of Strahd’s teeth on her neck. (It was knitted for her by her late mother, Korina, who died of illness fourteen years ago.)
