In life, [[Root/Worlds/Barovia/NPCs/Ismark Kolyanovich\|Ismark]] Antonovich, also known as [[Root/Worlds/Barovia/NPCs/Ismark Kolyanovich\|Ismark]] the Great, was a mighty warrior and the burgomaster of the [[Root/Worlds/Barovia/Locations/Village of Barovia\|Village of Barovia]]. In his prime, he fought scores of vampires and other undead left behind when [[Root/Worlds/Barovia/NPCs/Strahd von Zarovich\|Strahd]] vanished from public view. He eventually died defending a group of trappers from a dire wolf attack at the age of 44, and the statue outside was erected in his honor. [[Root/Worlds/Barovia/NPCs/Ismark Kolyanovich\|Ismark]] Antonovich was [[Root/Worlds/Barovia/NPCs/Ismark Kolyanovich\|Ismark]] Kolyanovich's great grandfather. [[Root/Worlds/Barovia/NPCs/Ismark Kolyanovich\|Ismark]]'s father gave him that name in the hopes that he would one day become a great warrior.Â
