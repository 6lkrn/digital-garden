**Daisy** is a [[Kenku\|Kenku]] child sent by the [[Root/Worlds/Faerun/Factions/Consortium of Shadows\|Consortium of Shadows]] to accompany Lilluth, Fate, Stellaluna, and Solaris into the land of [[Root/Worlds/Barovia/Locations/Barovia\|Barovia]]. She is missing and presumed dead after the burning of the [[Root/Worlds/Barovia/Locations/Wizard of Wines\|Wizard of Wines]] Winery.

Daisy was named by the orc Garrag, her caretaker within the Consortium. Garrag introduced the party to Daisy when he brought them to the entrance to [[Root/Worlds/Barovia/Locations/Barovia\|Barovia]], on the outskirts of Deep Harbor. Daisy traveled with the party to [[Root/Worlds/Barovia/Locations/Barovia\|Barovia]]. The party, especially Fate, became very attached to the child.

The first time that the party fought the hags at [[Root/Worlds/Barovia/Locations/Old Bonegrinder\|Old Bonegrinder]], Daisy was badly injured, so the party sent her ahead to [[Root/Worlds/Barovia/Locations/Barovia\|Barovia]] with [[Root/Worlds/Barovia/NPCs/Vasili von Holz\|Vasili von Holz]] before fighting the hags again. They left Daisy with Vasili again while they dined at [[Root/Worlds/Barovia/Locations/Castle Ravenloft\|Castle Ravenloft]] with [[Root/Worlds/Barovia/NPCs/Strahd von Zarovich\|Strahd von Zarovich]] and [[Root/Worlds/Barovia/NPCs/Ismark Kolyanovich\|Ismark Kolyanovich]], and then took her with them back to [[Root/Worlds/Barovia/Locations/Vallaki\|Vallaki]] and subsequently to [[Root/Worlds/Barovia/Locations/Krezk\|Krezk]] and the [[Abbey of St. Markovia\|Abbey of St. Markovia]].

At the [[Root/Worlds/Barovia/Locations/Wizard of Wines\|Wizard of Wines]] Winery, [[Root/Worlds/Barovia/NPCs/Elsa Martikov\|Elsa Martikov]] helped the party escape Strahd and [[Vanargand\|Vanargand]], but recommended that Daisy stay behind at the winery, where she thought it would be safer. Shortly thereafter, however, the party saw Strahd burn the winery. [[Root/Worlds/Barovia/NPCs/Fyodor Martikov\|Fyodor Martikov]] told them that there are multiple escape routes and havens outside of the winery, but he was unsure how many, if any, people had escaped the fire.
