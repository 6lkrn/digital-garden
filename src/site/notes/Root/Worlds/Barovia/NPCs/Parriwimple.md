Nephew of [[Root/Worlds/Barovia/NPCs/Bildrath Cantemir\|Bildrath Cantemir]].  
# **Description:**
A simple-minded, strong-bodied stock boy. 

A hulking silhouette steps forward from the mist—a young man, tall and brawny. His shaggy brown hair falls messily across his face, and his crooked teeth glint in the moonlight. Though muscles ripple beneath his tunic, there's a lightness and immaturity to his posture that belies his strength and size.

# **Knowledge:** 
Parriwimple can share the following information with the players: 

Father Donavich used to be a kind and friendly man, always ready to share a word of wisdom or a warm crabapple pie with visitors. 

Ever since the siege started, however, Donavich has shut himself inside the church and turned away visitors more often than not. 

Father Donavich hasn’t worn his holy symbol (a bronze sunburst) since the rebellion, which [[Root/Worlds/Barovia/NPCs/Parriwimple\|Parriwimple]] considers odd. (Parriwimple always loved how the light would glint off of its surface, and adored hearing [[Root/Worlds/Barovia/NPCs/Donavich\|Donavich]]’s son, [[Root/Worlds/Barovia/NPCs/Doru\|Doru]], tell stories of how the sun once shone in [[Root/Worlds/Barovia/Locations/Barovia\|Barovia]].)
