# **Full Character History:**

The Durst children, [[Root/Worlds/Barovia/NPCs/Rose Durst\|Rose Durst]] and [[Root/Worlds/Barovia/NPCs/Thorn Durst\|Thorn Durst]], were neglected by their parents and locked in this room until they starved to death

 

The children don’t like it when the characters disturb their toys, but they fight only in self-defense. Unlike the illusions outside the house, these children know that they’re dead. If asked how they died, Rose and Thorn explain that their parents locked them in the attic to protect them from “the monster in the basement,” and that they died from hunger. If asked how one gets to the basement, Rose points to the dollhouse and says, “There’s a secret door in the attic.” Characters who then search the dollhouse for secret doors gain advantage on their Wisdom (Perception) checks to find them.
 
The children fear abandonment. **If one or more characters try to leave, the ghost-children attempt to possess them**. If one of the ghosts possesses a character, allow the player to retain control of the character, but assign the character one of the following flaws:
 

-   **A character possessed by Rose gains the following flaw:** “I like being in charge and get angry when other people tell me what to do.

 
A character possessed by the ghost of Rose or Thorn won’t willingly leave Death House or the dungeon below it. Both ghosts can be intimidated into leaving their hosts with a successful DC 11 Charisma (Intimidation) check made as an action.
 
A ghost reduced to 0 hit points can reform at dawn the next day. The only way to put the children’s spirits to rest is to put their skeletal remains in their tombs (**areas 23E and 23F**). The children don’t know this, however.
