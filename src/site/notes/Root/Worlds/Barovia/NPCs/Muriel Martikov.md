Muriel is perhaps the most active of the non-Martikov members of the Order of the Feather, and can be found exploring the various nooks and crannies of [[Root/Worlds/Barovia/Locations/Barovia\|Barovia]] for clues that could help her cause. Naturally shy, but curious, she maintains her raven form while monitoring the characters throughout [[Root/Worlds/Barovia/Locations/Barovia\|Barovia]], appearing from time to time and assisting them if she believes they need help. Muriel dyes the tips of her wings blue, a vain practice that could endanger her.

# **Description:**

A wereraven encountered in [[Root/Worlds/Barovia/Locations/Berez\|Berez]], spying on Baba Lysaga
 

# **Character History:**

 In 1538, Muriel went missing and was presumed to be dead. In reality, however, she was merely imprisoned by [Baba Lysaga](https://alberons-mistake.fandom.com/wiki/Baba_Lysaga "Baba Lysaga") in her creeping hut. After [Lilluth](https://alberons-mistake.fandom.com/wiki/Lilluth_Chaemaer "Lilluth Chaemaer"), [Fate](https://alberons-mistake.fandom.com/wiki/Fate "Fate"), [Stellaluna](https://alberons-mistake.fandom.com/wiki/Stellaluna_Silverleaf "Stellaluna Silverleaf"), [Solaris](https://alberons-mistake.fandom.com/wiki/Solaris_Silverleaf "Solaris Silverleaf"), [Ezmerelda](https://alberons-mistake.fandom.com/wiki/Ezmerelda_d%27Avenir "Ezmerelda d'Avenir"), and [Ireena](https://alberons-mistake.fandom.com/wiki/Ireena_Kolyana "Ireena Kolyana") defeated Lysaga, they freed Muriel. Having been trapped for years in a raven form, Muriel had difficulty remembering anything, but did continuously ask for Katarina. Since the [Wizard of Wines Winery](https://alberons-mistake.fandom.com/wiki/Wizard_of_Wines_Winery "Wizard of Wines Winery") had recently been burned, the party sent Muriel to [Vallaki](https://alberons-mistake.fandom.com/wiki/Vallaki "Vallaki") and the [Blue Water Inn](https://alberons-mistake.fandom.com/wiki/Blue_Water_Inn "Blue Water Inn") with Ezmerelda.

###### Bio:

Muriel Vinshaw is a wereraven scout for the [Keepers of the Feather](https://strahdsbod.obsidianportal.com/wikis/keepers-of-the-feather). She is battle hardened by years of surviving in the [Svalich Woods](https://strahdsbod.obsidianportal.com/wikis/svalich-woods). She seems to prefer living on her own in the wilderness, and is rarely seen among the other wereravens in [Vallaki](https://strahdsbod.obsidianportal.com/wikis/vallaki).

Muriel assisted our heroes when they encountered [Baba Lysaga](https://strahdsbod.obsidianportal.com/characters/baba-lysaga) in [Berez](https://strahdsbod.obsidianportal.com/wikis/ruins-of-berez), and when they were attacked by [[[Rahadin\|[Rahadin]]](https://strahdsbod.obsidianportal.com/characters/[[Root/Worlds/Barovia/NPCs/Rahadin\|rahadin]]) in [Khazan’s Tower](https://strahdsbod.obsidianportal.com/wikis/khazans-tower).
