# **DM Notes:**

-   If she is restored to life by her brother (see "[[Root/Worlds/Barovia/NPCs/Kasimir\|Kasimir]]'s Dark Gift" in the "Special Events" section in chapter 13), Patrina (NE female dusk elf) returns as an **archmage** with no spells prepared. If the characters have her spellbook, she kindly asks them to give it back to her so that she can prepare her long-forgotten spells and help destroy Strahd (a lie). If the characters oblige, she repays their kindness by learning as much about them as possible before pursuing her own goals.
