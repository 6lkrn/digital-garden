# **Character History:**

Motivations. Ismark is a guilty man trying his best to keep his village and [[Root/Worlds/Barovia/NPCs/Ireena Kolyana\|Ireena]] safe, keep his father's memory alive, and one day match his ancestor's legacy. 

He is always anxious to prove himself and give aid to all those that need it. What he wants most of all is approval and to be accepted. 
He is insecure about his shortcomings and about being called "Ismark the Lesser".

Inspirations. When playing Ismark, channel Jon Snow (Game of Thrones), Faramir (Lord of the Rings), and Trevor Belmont (Castlevania). 

Persona. To the world, Ismark is a courageous, reliable, and compassionate leader. To those he trusts, Ismark is a self-doubting, strugglinzg warrior desperate to keep his loved ones safe. Deep down, Ismark worries that he will never live up to his ancestor's deeds—and fears that he has already irreparably failed. 

# **Knowledge:**

The [[Root/Worlds/Barovia/Locations/Village of Barovia\|Village of Barovia]] was recently decimated by a siege from [[Root/Worlds/Barovia/NPCs/Strahd von Zarovich\|Strahd]]'s undead forces. While the undead were dispatched, the village suffered heavily, and many Barovians fled to [[Root/Worlds/Barovia/Locations/Vallaki\|Vallaki]], a fortified town to the west. Many are still missing, and Ismark has had to dispatch several search parties across the nearby woods in search of survivors. 

All Barovians call [[Root/Worlds/Barovia/NPCs/Strahd von Zarovich\|Strahd]] “the Devil,” fearing that speaking his name gives him power and draws his attention. (This is a myth.) Ismark is unsure whether he believes this, but warns the players that [[Root/Worlds/Barovia/NPCs/Strahd von Zarovich\|Strahd]]’s spies are thought to be always watching— bats, wolves, and even human servants, including some among the [[Root/Worlds/Barovia/Factions/Vistani\|Vistani]]. 

If the players ask about Mary and [[Root/Worlds/Barovia/NPCs/Gertruda\|Gertruda]], Ismark can share the following information: 

Just over three months ago, [[Root/Worlds/Barovia/NPCs/Gertruda\|Gertruda]]'s betrothed, a man named [[Root/Worlds/Barovia/NPCs/Doru\|Doru]], led a revolt against [[Root/Worlds/Barovia/Locations/Castle Ravenloft\|Castle Ravenloft]]. [[Root/Worlds/Barovia/NPCs/Doru\|Doru]] and the members of his mob never returned. 

Shortly thereafter, a dusk elf named [[Root/Worlds/Barovia/NPCs/Rahadin\|Rahadin]] visited the village to deliver a warning: the Devil had awoken from his coffin, and the villagers of [[Root/Worlds/Barovia/Locations/Barovia\|Barovia]] had ninety days to make peace with their gods. Some Barovians fled for 

[[Root/Worlds/Barovia/Locations/Vallaki\|Vallaki]], but a majority chose to remain in [[Root/Worlds/Barovia/Locations/Barovia\|Barovia]] and defend their homes. 

Two weeks ago, [[Root/Worlds/Barovia/NPCs/Strahd von Zarovich\|Strahd]] made good on his threat. A horde of undead came to lay siege on [[Root/Worlds/Barovia/Locations/Barovia\|Barovia]]. The villagers fended them off for a week, but suffered dozens of casualties. The siege only ended when Ismark's father, Burgomaster [[Root/Worlds/Barovia/NPCs/Kolyan Indirovich\|Kolyan Indirovich]], perished in battle and the undead withdrew. 

[[Root/Worlds/Barovia/NPCs/Ismark Kolyanovich\|Ismark Kolyanovich]] made a deal with Strahd but he does not trust them. He has asked the Ravens to help him hide Ireena somewhere else.
