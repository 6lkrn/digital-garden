Black pools of water stand like dark mirrors in and around the muddy roadway. Giant trees loom on both sides of the road, their branches clawing at the mist. If the characters are walking along the road, they arrive at area B after 5 hours. If the characters are traveling in Vistani wagons, the travel time is halved.

### Watched
As the players travel down the road, read: 

Heavy mists roll in across the road, creeping between the weather-worn trees like gnarled, ghostly fingers. The air carries an unnatural chill, and the hush of silence falls over the woods like a burial shroud. 

As you walk, something catches your eye—a hunched silhouette in the fog, watching silently from the underbrush. 

Then, as quickly as it came, it vanishes. 

Pause briefly to allow the players to interject. If they do not, proceed to read the following: 

Your footsteps quicken on the path, boots squelching in the wet brown mud. Gray-tinged light filters weakly through the treetops—and then darkens, an enormous avian shadow overhead briefly blocking out the day. It disappears, leaving not even a stir to the air in its wake. 

Not moments pass before the daylight blinks out once again—this time, by a reptilian silhouette that soars across the heavens, batlike wings spread wide. It, too, plunges into the mists, devoured by the fog as dozens of tiny, birdlike shadows flit among the ancient branches far above. The birds' silhouettes follow the dragon's into the mist, and silence falls once more.
