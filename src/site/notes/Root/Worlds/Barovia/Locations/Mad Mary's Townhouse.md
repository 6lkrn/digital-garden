#### [[Root/Worlds/Barovia/NPCs/Mad Mary\|Mad Mary]]'s Townhouse

A moaning sob floats through the still, gray streets, coloring your thoughts with sadness. The sounds flow from a dark, two-story townhouse.

The house, which is about 40 feet square, is boarded up and barricaded from the inside. [[Root/Worlds/Barovia/NPCs/Gertruda\|Gertruda]] sits in the center of the floor in an upstairs bedroom, clutching a malformed doll. She is lost in her sorrow and despondency. She barely recognizes the presence of anyone in the room. She says nothing in the presence of anger, but she will talk, albeit haltingly, to someone who talks with her gently. 

The malformed doll has a strange leer and wears a sackcloth dress. It belonged to Mary in her youth and was passed down to [[Root/Worlds/Barovia/NPCs/Gertruda\|Gertruda]]. [[Root/Worlds/Barovia/NPCs/Gadof Blinsky\|Gadof Blinsky]], the toy maker of [[Root/Worlds/Barovia/Locations/Vallaki\|Vallaki]], made the doll. Stitched into the hem of its dress is a frayed tag bearing the words "Is No Fun, Is No Blinsky!"
