### Amber Vestiges 

The vestiges of the Amber Temple are not sentient as most would imagine it; as the decaying remnants of dead gods, they are mere scraps of malevolent power, described further 
in Chapter 13: The Amber Temple (p. 181), Amber Sarcophagi (p. 191), and X33. Amber Vaults (p. 191). 

Even so, that is not dead which can eternal lie. From the chill of their amber tombs, these vestiges dream of the power they once wielded—and of a path to renewed apotheosis. 

Shards of their amber sarcophagi are scattered across the land of Barovia, with each shard bearing a psychic connection to the vestige it once imprisoned. Through these shards, the vestiges can whisper words of corruption, promising power without price. This is a lie: no power is without cost, and the shreds of darkness the vestiges offer warp and transform their recipients—in subtle ways at first, but swelling grotesquely over time. 

Elisabeth Durst of Death House once bore one of these amber shards; [[Root/Worlds/Barovia/NPCs/Izek Strazni\|Izek Strazni]] of Vallaki holds one today. These shards are merely a gateway, however—through small tastes of power, the vestiges hope to lure their victims to the Amber Temple itself. There, the vestiges can offer their greatest dark gifts—and, in doing so, claim their true price and prize: a sliver of the victim’s soul. 

With each scrap of spirit a vestige claims, it grows in power, inching closer to the day that it will have the strength to break free of its amber prison. One has already succeeded. 

Others are now on the precipice. And for those that remain—eternity is full of possibilities, and the dead have nothing but time.
