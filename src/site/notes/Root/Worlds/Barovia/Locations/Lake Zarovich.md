# **Introduction (Area K):**

 <table><tbody><tr class="odd"><td><blockquote><p>At the foot of a mountain, nestled in the misty forest, is a large lake. The water is perfectly still and dark, reflecting the black clouds overhead like a monstrous mirror.</p></blockquote></td></tr></tbody></table>

If the characters arrive along the shore north of Vallaki
in the daytime, add:
 

<table><tbody><tr class="odd"><td><blockquote><p>Pulled up along the south shore are three small rowboats. A fourth boat can be seen in the middle of the lake, with a lone figure sitting in it, fishing pole in hand.</p></blockquote></td></tr></tbody></table>

 
Each rowboat can safely hold five people. The person fishing on the lake is [[Root/Worlds/Barovia/NPCs/Bluto Krogarov\|Bluto Krogarov]] (NE male human commoner), a resident of [[Root/Worlds/Barovia/Locations/Vallaki\|Vallaki]]. He is in a trance and doesn't respond to anything or anyone unless attacked. His boat is 400 feet from the nearest shore. Tied up in the boat is a seven-year-old Vistana named [[Root/Worlds/Barovia/NPCs/Arabelle\|Arabelle]] (LN female human commoner with 2 hit points and no effective attacks).
 

# **[[Root/Worlds/Barovia/NPCs/Bluto Krogarov\|Bluto Krogarov]]** 

[[Root/Worlds/Barovia/NPCs/Bluto Krogarov\|Bluto Krogarov]] is a destitute drunkard. He's desperate to catch some fish and trade them for wine at the Blue Water Inn. After he was unable to catch a single fish for a week, he kidnapped Arabelle, believing that Vistani are lucky. He intends to sacrifice her to the lake, hoping it will give up some of its fish in return. If the characters watch Bluto from the shore for several minutes, or if they row out into the lake to greet him, he tosses the burlap sack into the water, watches it sink, and waits with fishing pole in hand for his reward . 
Bluto is a hollow shell of a man, barely able to understand his own actions. He is unarmed and does nothing to aid or thwart the characters.

ROLEPLAYING ARABELLE
Characters who act quickly can save Arabelle before she drowns. A character on the shore must succeed on a DC 15 Strength (Athletics) check to reach her in time.
The DC is 10 for characters who took a rowboat out onto the lake.
Arabelle has alabaster-white skin and raven-black hair. If rescued, she demands to be returned to her family's camp outside Vallaki (chapter 5, area N9). She is certain that her father, [[Root/Worlds/Barovia/NPCs/Luvash\|Luvash]], will give the characters a reward for doing so.
A descendant of [[Root/Worlds/Barovia/NPCs/Madam Eva\|Madam Eva]] with the blood of Barovian royalty in her veins, Arabelle is unaware of her connection to Strahd. She acts more like an adult than a child. Despite her recent misadventure, she believes that a great destiny awaits her.
