When the characters come within sight of this river for the first time, read:

> This river flows as clear as a blue winter sky through the valley. 
 
The river is roughly 50 feet wide, with a depth ranging from 5 to 10 feet. Arching stone bridges span the river at two points, one near the [[Root/Worlds/Barovia/Locations/Village of Barovia\|Village of Barovia]] and the other near [[Root/Worlds/Barovia/Locations/Tser Falls\|Tser Falls]].
