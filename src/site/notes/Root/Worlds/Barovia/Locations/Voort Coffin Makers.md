**# **Introduction, Henrik**

N6F. VAMPIRE NEST  
This large, drafty room is strung with cobwebs and takes up most of the upper Aoor. Stacks of wooden planks lie amid several crates marked "JUNK." The two southernmost crates contain old junk that Henrik has accumulated over the years. The six crates in the northern part of the room are packed with earth and serve as resting places for the six vampire spawn that lair here. If the characters open one of the occupied crates, all of the vampire spawn burst forth and attack.  

Teleport Destination. Characters who teleport to this location from area K78 in Castle Ravenloft arrive at the point marked T on the map.  


N6. COFFIN MAKER'S SHOP'
This uninviting shop is two stories tall and has a sign shaped like a coffin above the front door. All of the window shutters are closed up tight, and a deathly silence surrounds the establishment.

Henrik van der Voort is a mediocre carpenter and a troubled, lonely man. He profits from the 'deaths of others, and no one desires his company, because of the ghastly nature of his handiwork. One night several months ago, Strahd visited Henrik in the guise of an imposing, well-dressed nobleman named Vasili von Holtz and promised the coffin maker "good business" in exchange for his help. Since then, Henrik's workshop has become the lair of a pack of vampire spawn-former adventurers who were turned by Strahd. These vampires are lying low for the time being. 

The vampires plan to attack St. Andral's church (see "St. Andral's Feast" in the "Special Events" section at the end of this chapter). When Henrik learned about the sacred bones buried under the church, the vampire spawn ordered him to steal the bones, which Henrik paid Milivoj the gravedigger (see area Nl) to do. Every window of Henrik's shop is a latticework of iron fitted with squares of frosted glass and locked from the inside. The outside doors of the shop are barred shut from within. If the characters knock on one of them, Henrik shouts, "We're closed! Go away!" without opening the door. If the characters accuse Henrik of stealing the bones of St. Andral, he shouts again, "Go away! Leave me alone!"

If the characters break into the store, Henrik offers no resistance. He tells them where to find the bones (in the upstairs bedroom wardrobe, area N6e) and the vampire nest (in the upstairs wood storage room, area N6f). If the characters report the theft of the bones to the burgomaster, Baron Vallakovich dispatches four guards to arrest Henrik and retrieve the bones. If the guards show up during daylight hours, Henrik surrenders him self and the bones without a fight, claiming that vampires forced him to steal the bones. If the guards come at night, Henrik surrenders himself and tells the guards where the bones are hidden, but he won't retrieve the bones himself for fear of being killed by the vampires.

N6c. WORKSHOP
This workshop contains everything a carpenter needs to make coffins and furniture. Three sturdy worktables stretch the length of the west wall. Henrik builds coffins and keeps his carpenter's tools in this room.

N6o. KITCHEN
IThis kitchen contains a square table surrounded by Ichairs and shelves of provisions. Henrik prepares his meals here.


Treasure. The wardrobe in the southeast corner has a secret compartment in its base, requiring a successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check to find. Inside the compartment are two sacks-a large one containing the bones of St. Andral and a small one containing 30 sp and 12 ep. All of the coins bear the profiled visage of Strahd von Zarovich.
