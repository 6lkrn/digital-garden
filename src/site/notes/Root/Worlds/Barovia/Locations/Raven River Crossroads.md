Always check for a random encounter whenever the characters reach area R.

This stretch of the [[Root/Worlds/Barovia/Locations/Old Svalich Road\|Old Svalich Road]] has multiple branches. One branch heads north, quickly turning into a dirt path that leads to [[Van Richten's Tower\|Van Richten's Tower]] on [[Root/Worlds/Barovia/Locations/Lake Baratok\|Lake Baratok]] (area V). One branch heads south, becoming [[Root/Worlds/Barovia/Locations/Tsolenka Pass\|Tsolenka Pass]] (area T) as it winds through the lower mountains and clings to the side of [[Root/Worlds/Barovia/Locations/Mount Ghakis\|Mount Ghakis]]. A third branch heads west toward the[[Root/Worlds/Barovia/Locations/Wizard of Wines\|Wizard of Wines]] winery and vineyard (area W), dipping south as it changes from a road into a gravel trail.

Standing at the intersection of the [[Root/Worlds/Barovia/Locations/Old Svalich Road\|Old Svalich Road]] and the road to the winery is a signpost:

> You see a weatherworn signpost next to the road. The three arms of the sign point along the three branches of the road. The arm pointing north reads [[Root/Worlds/Barovia/Locations/Krezk\|Krezk]], and through the woods you can see an arching stone bridge spanning a river. The arm pointing east reads [[Root/Worlds/Barovia/Locations/Vallaki\|Vallaki]], and the road slopes up gradually in that direction. The arm pointing southwest reads the [[Root/Worlds/Barovia/Locations/Wizard of Wines\|Wizard of Wines]]. The road slopes gently downward in that direction.
