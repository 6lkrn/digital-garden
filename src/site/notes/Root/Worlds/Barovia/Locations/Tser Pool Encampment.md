> The road gradually disappears and is replaced by a twisted, muddy path through the trees. Deep ruts in the earth are evidence of the comings and goings of wagons. 
> The canopy of mist and branches suddenly gives way to black clouds boiling far above. There is a clearing here, next to a river that widens to form a small lake several hundred feet across. Five colorful round tents, each ten feet in diameter, are pitched outside a ring of four barrel-topped wagons. A much larger tent stands near the shore of the lake, its sagging form lit from within. Near this tent, eight unbridled horses drink from the river. 
> The mournful strains of an accordion clash with the singing of several brightly clad figures around bonfire. A footpath continues beyond this encampment, meandering north between the river and the forest's edge. 

The eight draft horses drinking from the river are used to pull the [[Root/Worlds/Barovia/Factions/Vistani\|Vistani]] wagons and aren't easily startled. If the characters are brought to this camp by the [[Root/Worlds/Barovia/Factions/Vistani\|Vistani]], their escorts remain at the camp and don't accompany the adventuring party any farther. 
Twelve [[Root/Worlds/Barovia/Factions/Vistani\|Vistani]] (CN male and female human bandits) are standing and sitting around the fire, telling stories and guzzling wine. They are intoxicated and have disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks. Three sober [[Root/Worlds/Barovia/Factions/Vistani\|Vistani]] (CN male and female human bandit captains) are resting in three of the four wagons but leap quickly into action if an alarm is raised. 
Although the [[Root/Worlds/Barovia/Factions/Vistani\|Vistani]] in this camp are in league with Strahd, they attack only if the characters provoke them with threats or insults. Otherwise, the characters are offered flasks of wine and invited to join the reverie. 
If the characters linger at the camp, continue with "A Vistana's Tale" below. If they seem in a hurry to leave, one of the [[Root/Worlds/Barovia/Factions/Vistani\|Vistani]] tells them, "It was fated that you would visit our humble camp. [[Root/Worlds/Barovia/NPCs/Madam Eva\|Madam Eva]] foretold your coming. She awaits you." The Vistana then points to the largest tent. If the characters head that way, continue with "[[Root/Worlds/Barovia/NPCs/Madam Eva\|Madam Eva]]'s Tent." 

#### A Vistana's Tale

If the characters linger by the fire, one of the Vistani recounts the following tale: 

>"A mighty wizard came to this land over a year ago. I remember him like it was yesterday. He stood exactly where you're standing. A very charismatic man, he was. He thought he could rally the people of [[Root/Worlds/Barovia/Locations/Barovia\|Barovia]] against the devil Strahd. He stirred them with thoughts of revolt and bore them to the castle en masse
>"When the vampire appeared, the wizard's peasant army fled in terror. A few stood their ground and were never seen again. "The wizard and the vampire cast spells at each other. Their battle flew from the courtyards of Ravenloft to a precipice overlooking the falls. I saw the battle with my own eyes. Thunder shook the mountainside, and great rocks tumbled down upon the wizard, yet by his magic he survived. Lightning from the heavens struck the wizard, and again he stood his ground. But when the devil Strahd fell upon him, the wizard's magic couldn't save him. I saw him thrown a thousand feet to his death. I climbed down to the river to search for the wizard's body, to see if, you know, he had anything of value, but the [[River lvlis\|River lvlis]] had already spirited him away." 

The Vistana storyteller doesn't remember the wizard's name, but recalls that it sounded important. If the characters haven't spoken with [[Root/Worlds/Barovia/NPCs/Madam Eva\|Madam Eva]], the storyteller urges them to do so.

##### [[Root/Worlds/Barovia/NPCs/Madam Eva\|Madam Eva]]'s Tent
If the characters decide to see [[Root/Worlds/Barovia/NPCs/Madam Eva\|Madam Eva]], read:
> Magic flames cast a reddish glow over the interior of this tent, revealing a low table covered in a black velvet cloth. Glints of light seem to flash from a crystal ball on the table as a hunched figure peers into its depths. As the crone speaks, her voice crackles like dry weeds. "At last you have arrived!" Cackling laughter bursts like mad lightning from her withered lips.

[[Root/Worlds/Barovia/NPCs/Madam Eva\|Madam Eva]] (see appendix D) speaks the name of each party member and makes some reference to that individual's past deeds. She then asks the characters if they want their fortunes read. If they say yes, [[Root/Worlds/Barovia/NPCs/Madam Eva\|Madam Eva]] produces a worn deck of cards and proceeds with the sequence outlined in chapter 1. (If the characters don't want a reading of their fates, continue play using the card reading you performed before starting the adventure.) [[Root/Worlds/Barovia/NPCs/Madam Eva\|Madam Eva]] might seem mad, but she is, in fact, cunning and sharp of mind. She has met a good many adventurers in her time and knows they can't be fully trusted. She wants to free the land of [[Root/Worlds/Barovia/Locations/Barovia\|Barovia]] from its curse, and her fate is interwoven with Strahd's (see appendix D for details). She does the vampire's bidding when called upon and does nothing to anger Strahd or bring harm to the Vistani. She never gives aid and never
asks for any.

**TREASURE**
For each [[Root/Worlds/Barovia/Factions/Vistani\|Vistani]] tent or wagon that the characters search, roll once on the following table to determine what treasure is found:

  d20 - Treasure
01-10 - None
11-13 - Sack of 100 ep (each coin stamped with Strahd's visage in profile)
14-16 - Pouch containing 4d6 gemstones worth 100 gp each
17-19 - Sack containing 3d6 pieces of cheap jewelry worth 25 gp total and 1d6 pieces of fine jewelry worth 250 gp each
    20 - One magic item (roll once on Magic Item Table B in the Dungeon Master's Guide)

**FORTUNES OF RAVENLOFT**
If your card reading reveals that a treasure is here, it is hidden in one of the Vistani wagons. [[Root/Worlds/Barovia/NPCs/Madam Eva\|Madam Eva]] grants the characters permission to search the wagons if they ask, and any such search yields the treasure.
# Vistani 

The Vistani are largely as described in Vistani (p. 26), with two major semi-permanent settlements: the encampment at Tser Pool (as described in G. Tser Pool Encampment (p. 36)), and the encampment near Vallaki (as described in N9. Vistani Camp (p. 119)). 

However, most Barovian Vistani view the valley as a temporary shelter from the evils of the world beyond, or as a brief stopover on their journeys through the mists. Only a few Vistani within Barovia reside there permanently and regard Strahd as their "king"; among those that do, even fewer serve Strahd faithfully as his eyes, ears, and hands amidst the valley. Most Barovian Vistani simply want to live their lives, to partake in life's wonders, and to raise their families in peace.
