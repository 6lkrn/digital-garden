#### Bildrath's Mercantile

The sparse light from this building spills out from behind drawn heavy curtains. The establishment is 70 feet long by 40 feet wide. 
The owner, Bildrath Cantemir (LN male human commoner), sells general items for two times the price. 

Bildrath trades with the Vistani when they pass through. He never bargains since, as he says, "If you want it badly enough, you'll pay for it." He has no competition in the village. If the characters give Bildrath a hard time, he calls Parriwimple (LG male human), his nephew and stock boy, to help him out. 

Parriwimple has the statistics of a gladiator, except that he has an Intelligence of 6 and doesn't carry a shield (AC 14). Parriwimple's real name is Parpol Cantemir, but no one in the village calls him that. His muscles rippling beneath his leather tunic should give ample notice of his strength. At the same time, Parriwimple is simple-minded. He is devoted to his uncle and will not follow the characters as long as Bildrath has something to say about it.

**Bildrath:**
The owner, [[Root/Worlds/Barovia/NPCs/Bildrath Cantemir\|Bildrath Cantemir]] (LN male human commoner), sells items from the Adventuring Gear table in the Player's Handbook, but only items with a price lower than 25 gp in the table, and he sells them for ten times the price.  

If Ismark is present (or if the players mention him), Bildrath mocks him as “Ismark the Lesser” and instead raises his prices to five times the price, spitefully claiming them to be a “special deal” for friends of the town’s “great hero.” ([[Root/Worlds/Barovia/NPCs/Bildrath Cantemir\|Bildrath]] lost his sister and brother-in-law—[[Root/Worlds/Barovia/NPCs/Parriwimple\|Parriwimple]]’s parents—in Strahd’s recent siege, and blames Ismark for his failure to protect them.) During the players’ conversation with Bildrath, Parriwimple enters the room carrying a box of wares that [[Root/Worlds/Barovia/NPCs/Bildrath Cantemir\|Bildrath]] asked him to fetch. He is excitedly curious about the players’ presence, but Bildrath orders him to return to his bedroom in order to avoid “disturbing the customers.” 

**Parriwimple**:
[[Root/Worlds/Barovia/NPCs/Parriwimple\|Parriwimple]] is Bildrath's nephew and works as a stockboy. If Bildrath orders Parriwimple to remove the players from the store, Parriwimple attempts to grapple them and pull them out the door, preferring to avoid violence if at all possible.
