# Aefiryon (World 2)

- A flat world, all the rivers flow down into the abyss. A world without any oceans, just endless expanse of trees. The outer edges of the forest are inhibited by civilisations.
    
- The civilisation stopped at the edges because the deeper one goes into the forest, the darker and more twisted it becomes. The closer one gets to the heart (middle) of the forest it became more and more weird, animals became 10x bigger, trees as high as it could be and as big as an entire city even. It had been speculated and some rumours that there are civilisations in the forest itself.
    
- The rumoured civilisations are called the Indigenous, they are the original inhabitants of Aefiryon. These people can traverse the forest safely and with guidance of the spirits. 
    
- In order to traverse across the forest, magical gates and airships are used to cross it. To traverse the forest itself by foot is foolish and never been done in the history of the outer civilisations.
    
- The existence of fire is a concerning subject. However, the people of the world are taught either by their elders or at school or by sacred texts left by the gods, to control the flames and not to let the flames engulf the world.
    
- Lighting a fire in the forest also has some detrimental effects, animals will go crazy and the worst of all the spirits. They will not only quench the fire but will also kill anyone that is in the immediate vicinity of the flame.
    
- However, the exception of this rule are the outer edges. Where civilisations are built, theories by the various scholars is that the spirits are weaker at the outer edges and stronger the deeper it is into the forest. Invention of the magical lights source has been a help to traverse the forest.
    
- The reason for the invention is, not a good one. The civilisations are looking to use the spirit’s power for themselves. 
    

  

### Magic System 

- The Indegenous uses the spirits of the forest or the Ephram as they call them as weapons and armours. However, they must have a mutual agreement with the individual Ephrams and the Indegenous. 
    
- There are 4 types of Ephrams,
