[[Root/Campaigns/Players/Ashie\|Ashie]]

“Oh to be the child of the rich, what a dream that would be” was a comment sentiment held by the [[Common\|Common]] folk ruled under Monika Lancaster, a Duchess of Amn. Oh yes, Monika Lancaster was well respected. A beautiful and caring woman by all accounts. Her long black curly hair complimented the lavish and somewhat impractical dresses she would wear. Not a single peasant under her had an ill opinion on their ruler, save for the jealous and the uncultured. Her people would enjoy seasonal festivals, clean streets and even news of their wonderful duchess helping [[Common\|Common]] folk till fields.  
It was no surprise when Lady Lancaster married a [[Commoner\|Commoner]] named Jackson Newman, Soon to be a Lancaster. Much like their frequent festivals, the wedding was a spectacle one could only fully appreciate had they been there. Not long after the lancasters would be blessed with a baby boy, curiously named manric.  
  
Manric and his father were really the only two living things to see the duchess without her facade. She would spend her time when not educating manric sitting in her office, reading and writing. Directing her servants to carry out her orders to a T. Manric was never quite sure why she was so bitter towards him; he would soon learn it was best not to talk unless spoken to. He would still listen, hearing all the perpetuated lies she used to gain control.

 It was true that her time was “spending time with her loving husband and child” But it wasn't the reason you would assume. She had taken a leap of public absence, yes, (still controlling her territory of course) but it wasn't to spend time with her family. it was to relieve the stress of having to spend so much time with the dirt folk. As she put it. Helping till the fields? Please. Not her. Nothing more than a carefully curated rumor. Her joyous and kind demeanor to the commoners? A mask to sway their hearts. A peasant husband? He was barely seen as more than a trophy to her, a concubine even.

  

Manric had more pressing things on his mind though, he was meant to be the heir to his mothers territory and she was brutal in her pursuit to chisel Manric into a perfect child. Not a moment of Manrics' waking moments was spent on anything besides perfecting how to walk, to talk, sing, dance and play the violin. All things Monika saw as necessary for any real gentleman. From a very young age one rule was made very clear, Manric must always be obedient and perfect. He would do his best in these regards, not to appease her but to avoid punishment.

 Her definition of failure was something as slim as a voice crack. Her favorite punishment was ten lashes to each of his wrists. On particularly bad mishaps she would give him thirsty per wrist and lock him in a closet with his violin. Where if she found him not playing it when she returned would continue his sentence for another day and so forth, without food of course. Monika often wished she could punish Manric much more severely, though she knew she had to keep him presentable.  
Sometimes while locked away in the closet he would wonder if other little boys were punished in the same way. The thought passing as he realized he had been playing off key, the muffled yelling and stomping of his mother growing louder.

  
Despite the depravity of her methods, they were effective, molding Manric into a polite and smart young man. A deeply troubled and broken man at heart but extremely desirable and presentable to those who looked on from the outside.  
It wouldn't take long for Manric to seek connection outside of his family now that he was in his adulthood. A serf named Shan (though truly her name was “Shan-gguh, bone gnasher”. That was too gnarly for humans to call her.) a rugged and bold [[orc\|orc]]. A long purple scarf wrapped around her neck. The only token of her old home she still had. She was the exact opposite of his mother, far from the poisonous femininity Monika weaponized. A strong woman who was self reliant and bold. Someone who cared little for the arrogant charm Manric displayed.  
It would take some time, some pestering but Shan would eventually find Manric as a suitable person to love.  
  
In the passing months, Monika became skeptical of her son's growing joy. It was the very presence of his happiness that would first tip her off that something was arrigh. Nextt was his complete disinterest in every woman she threw at him no matter how pretty or intelligent. then the nights of his absence explained off by drinking until Monika finally sent someone to follow him when he snuck out of the estate she knew.  
Manric returned from his lover, ready for the same argument of the unprofessionality of his actions, going to a tavern at night and so forth but no. He was not met with the red faced screaming of his mother, Rather a cold expressionless one. Four thuggish looking men quietly standing with her.  
He would be joining the army at dawn, that brute he called a lover was already being dragged away to jail for murder and for all she cared he was no longer her son. Not for a moment did Manric hesitate to try and strangle that woman. Though the men with monika quickly sought to tie him up and barring him in a closet until day. where he was thrown onto a wagon and shipped to the capital. Monika made sure to inform him that the people of (monikas territory) were sad to see their young duke throw himself to the army, but they saw his actions and valiant. His soon to be born brother would have to take up the mantel.  
  
  
  
  
A new recruit kicking and screaming wasn't too rare of an occurrence, it's not like the poor bastard had a choice in the matter. Amn had been gearing up for some time. The threat of a lich grew ever closer as their undead army swept through the fringes of their nation. He would be broken down like all the others, turned into a suitable soldier.

Broken down he was, as ruthlessly as his mother he was torn down but unlike her he was built back up.

Shaped into a warring man as his mind walled off the trauma of his mother and the loss of his lover. He fell into it, into the grit and hardness of it. His division would grow fond of him and vice versa. Together in arms they fought to protect their nation. He had grown a particular fondness to the art of fistacuffs. The satisfaction of his own hands being a vessel for trangling a foe into submission gave him an odd feeling, as if satisfying a forgotten desire. Eventually even being rewarded with a weaponized pair of gauntlets to further extend his skill. 

No matter how hard he trained or how long it had been, Manric would sometimes hear news of Monika and her second born, Allison. Her birthdays and milestones would always seem to reach him somehow.  
  
Manric wasn’t totally sure what to expect against the undead. He hadn't even seen a corpse let alone a walking one. That wouldn't stop him from boasting that he was the bravest and strongest infantry there was, quick to punch down anyone who suggested he wasn't ready for what was ahead.  
As the rolling tide of corpses washed down the impasse of the mountain Manric knew in his heart the battle was over.  
The pike wall would have been effective against any living foe, pikemen strong and ready to evaporate the line of the charging enemy. The undead tide didn't even slow down, washing through them as if they weren't even there. In mere moments their frontline was broken.  
  
Manric was in the 6th division, assigned the role of a left flank that would descend into the enemy forces with arrow fire and horses as the frontline took on the brunt of the forces. He was lucky enough to be far away to miss the closer details but it wouldn't be long before his sergeant noticed the horde closing in on them.  
Their horses simply were not fast enough as quickly they were swarmed, much too undergeared to face the threat directly. No matter how many they trampled and cut down, there were always two more to replace them.  
Manrics death wasn't quick, gnashing teeth took his fingers and hands. Jaws gnawed all over his body desperately to crush through his armor. His body was already defeated but his will would not allow it, his glaive flailing hopelessly to the very last breath.  
  
  
  
Vanquish the undead. Vanquish the undead. Vanquish the undead.  
Those words rang through the man's head as he arose from the ground, ripping the helmet off of his head with a meaty tear.

Vanquish the undead. Vanquish the undead. Vanquish the undead.  
The man looked down at his hands, gray and mangled. He looked to himself, he was a soldier? Fully geared in armor bearing the unfamiliar insignia of a [[Lion\|Lion]] holding a sword in its jaw. He looked around himself, seeing the remnants of  a battlefield. Corpses of men sprawling forward into the horizon.

Vanquish the undead. Vanquish the undead, Vanquish the undead.  
The man felt confused, why was he here? Who was he? 

Vanquish the undead. Vanquish the undead. Vanquish the undead.

The man realized he wasn't breathing, nor did he feel a need to.  
Vanquish the undead. Vanquish the undead. Vanquish the undead.

The mantra repeated in his head, but it was not his own voice.  
Vanquish the undead. Vanquish the undead. Vanquish the undead.  
The man took up his javelin, equipped his helmet and marched to the mountains. He had all the answers he needed.  
  
“vanquish the undead.”  
  

  
The coming months for the Huntsman were bloodshirty. The mountains were all but crawling with untame undead. Every forest, every cave, every destroyed village the hunter made his way through ended with the dead returned to their rest. He even learned goblin and orcish to interrogate the locals of where the undead might be hiding, as any good hunter would. he liked that title, “huntsman”.  It was what he was after all, a huntsman. Despite the bloodlust he felt, the vigor that was his purpose. Something was wrong. A wrong that he couldn't right. The hunter didn't let that feeling consume them; they had more important things to do.  
“vanquish the undead. vanquish the undead. vanquish the undead.”  
The huntsman repeated softly, Searching tirelessly for another skull to crush.  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
A metallic figure steps into view, a clunking mess of damaged mail and plate. The Amn’s military force insignia, a rough and banged up [[Lion\|Lion]] clutching a sword in their mouth imprinted on the side of their helmet.  
Chains cross and weave around the armor, secure and tight with locks of various quality and [[Campaign Resources/Rules/5e/Combat/Size\|Campaign Resources/Rules/5e/Combat/Size]] keeping them in check.
