The Ribbonwood

neutral, dangerous, temperate, large, coastal woodland

  

COLOR

- cinnamon-orange bark against deep green leaves and undergrowth
    
- powerful fragrance of the Ribbonwood cedars
    
- patches of red earth flashing through ground cover
    
- shrouds of mist in low areas
    
- birdsong
    
- evening chorus of spring peepers
    
- tang of salt air closer to the coast
    

  

Cedar is a distinctive tall evergreen tree with a wide buttressing base, and a fibrous, fluted trunk with gray to cinnamon-red bark. Greenish-yellow leaves are flat with opposite scales. Branches are often J-shaped with upward pointed tips. Simple round flowers bloom in late summer and give the tree a yellowish appearance. They can rain a cloud of pollen in the spring that makes the air appear hazy, covering everything in fine golden dust.

  

Cedar seed cones have 8-12 scales, are about 1⁄2 inch long, and are shaped like rosebuds. They are ingeniously engineered to funnel pollen grains into the small spaces between the scales, like

wind turbines.

  

BOOTY

- cedar pollen (medicinal; 1sp/use): extracted from cedar cones.
    
- crimson pigment (2sp/creature): extracted from famujanah.
    
- fresh blackpods (rare, medicinal, spell component; 2sp/use): puffballs found under leaves and roots after rainfall.
    
- dhahabite (rare, charm, 2d10x2sp): green olivine, aka “luckstone,” which can be found in the river itself.
    

  

OPPORTUNITIES

Jasra el-Majid at the Spiral Arch in Dry Basin offers 7 qatae total per day for confirmation of a holy sign of Sayid Alghaba at the center of an area of old-growth Ribbonwood cedar.

  

Scion to the el-Majid family, Jasra came across a reference to the location in a scroll that has been in her family since the time of the Cataclysm. Although her family honored the Lord of the Wood, the existence of Sayid Alghaba has been expunged from official church records. Jasra seeks proof of the site’s existence so that she may mount a pilgrimage and make an offering. She cannot leave her holdings in Tadakhul untended for long, so she is enlisting the PCs to scout and confirm the existence of the site. The scroll is secured in her family’s library at Tadakhul, but she has committed the relevant portions to memory.

  

Jasra has been able to piece together clues from the text that indicate the site—called the Heart of the Wood (Qalb Min Alkhashab)—would be a day’s march upriver from the lost city of Tajamae, and referred to in the text thusly:  
  
“Walk one day up-river from the Gathering-Place [Tajamae], to the place where elbow touches knee. When the Father bids farewell, his Honored Son shall open the doors of his home to those of harmonious intention.”

  

Although Jasra claims ignorance about what lies at the Heart, elsewhere in the scroll it is described as the resting place of Sayid Alghaba, marked with his sign (the three-limbed, three-leaved branch). Proof of their mission will be a believable description of what the PCs find there.

  

The oxbow is four days’ journey north along the Dim Ribbon from Munhadir:

- 1st leg (1 day): travel from Munhadir to the Dim Ribbon (Fortress Ridge, unsafe, +1)
    
- 2nd leg (2.5 days): follow the Ribbon downstream to the oxbow (Ribbonwood, dangerous, +2).
    

  

Jasra el-Majid (Maesan armiger, she/her; chaotic (passion), loyal, petulant, manipulative; masterful (+3), strong, hardy, lucky, connected): notable chin, composed, risks bringing dishonor upon her house by nurturing devotion to Sayid Alghaba. Traveling incognito, anxious and secretive about the undertaking.

Heart of the Wood

neutral, perilous  
  

“Walk one day up-river from the Gathering-Place [Tajamae], to the place where elbow touches knee. When the Father bids farewell, his Honored Son shall open the doors of his home to those of harmonious intention.”

  

The Oxbow

“Where elbow touches knee” is an oxbow bend in the Dim Ribbon, in the loop of which stands a dense and towering expanse of old-growth cedar. The stand is normally impenetrable, but at twilight, when the sun’s rays slant in from the west, a shimmering curtain arises from the surrounding waters. Crossing the Ribbon during the brief window of opportunity brings you into the spirit realm of Sayid Alghaba, the slowly-dying forest god of the Adjat people. Once in this realm, stepping back into the waters of the Ribbon will return you to the mundane world the following dawn.  
  
The Ancient Cedars  
Within the spirit realm, where before the trees were too densely packed to allow passage, now the land itself seems to have expanded, creating space between the great trunks.  
  

- Trees even taller and more massive
    
- Air thick with woodland fragrance with a moldy undernote, air still and humid
    
- Only a few chirring insects and frogs can be heard
    
- A toppled tree here and there, drained of life, its roots consumed
    
- Solemn, funereal atmosphere.
    

  

When you take any aggressive action among the Ancient Cedars, they move to block your progress and force you back; in extreme cases they will entrap you.

  

When you push toward the center of the old-growth, you wend between towering trunks, climb stair-like roots, and push through massive, primordial ferns. Roll +WIS: on a 10+, mark 1 progress; on a 7-9, you encounter something; on a 6-, you become lost. When you mark 3 progress, you reach the Temple of the Forest Lord.

  

|   |   |
|---|---|
|Encounter|   |
|1|The Great Cedar (neutral). PC with lowest Luck is pressed up against the bole of the largest of the old-growth trees when it opens to swallow them.|
|2|Roots shift to drop trespassers into deep crevasse (1d6 damage)|
|3|A shower of cedar pollen falls, obscuring all vision and covering everyone in thick yellow dust.|
|4|The Storm Tree (good, divine). The jagged remains of a silver-barked tree at the center of a clearing, splintered by lightning into shards that are embedded in the surrounding landscape. Stormclouds swirl overhead, occasional flashes of heat lightning, rumbles of thunder. This clearing memorializes the death of Thalathat'ab, and his mark is burned into the earth, though mostly overgrown. One of the tree shards may be recovered and perhaps crafted into a magical spear.|
|5|Remains of intruders. The skeletons of 3 unfortunates—1 human, 1 alfiran, 1 buma—trapped in wood. From their remains may be recovered scraps of a once-fine robe, a quiver of blue-fletched arrows, a copper vial of cedar pollen, a seashell brooch (1sp) 6d10sp, and 3 gems: 1 large flawed malachite (3sp), 1 rough malachite (8sp), and 1 pale green dharamite (28sp).|
|6|Sage Sarra Golden-Eyes (bumese, she/her; neutral (knowledge), frugal, hedonist; adept (+1), hardy) fighting group of 7 giant woodworms with her staff. She wears striking white Ukrit robes and carries a shoulder bag, in which she has been collecting blackpods. She heard stories about the Temple of the Forest Lord and, hungry for knowledge, came to learn more. If she gets in a tight spot with the woodworms she can fly out of reach, but the tree cover is too dense to allow her to get vey high.|

  

Temple of the Forest Lord  
neutral

Built and tended by the el-Majid family centuries ago, the weathered remains of this stone temple are almost entirely obscured by vines and roots. Its existence spans the realms, but in the mundane world the density of the cedar grove prevents access. Ultimately, Jasra el-Majid will seek a way to restore this site; doing so make it accessible in the mundane world.
