Lair of Nereus

  

The Lair of Nereus is a half-sunken temple, and the former residence of Nereus, the Bronze Dragonking. 

  

This dungeon is intended for players of at least level 5. Depending on the stats you use for the merfolk, and for the final fight at the end, this dungeon could work for most level ranges.

  

### Lore

  

In his day, Nereus was the (more-or-less) benevolent ruler of a large island in the warm southern seas. Although he charged incredible taxes, the merchants of The Bronze Isle prospered while he ruled the local waters.

His palace was a magnificent multi-tiered tower that had been raised from the ocean bedrock. Through powerful enchantments, Nereus caused fresh water to flow from the top of his palace, and cascade down the many tiers. With this inexhaustible source of freshwater, the barren island became prosperous; trading fresh water for goods to ships that were travelling through this barren stretch of the sea.  
  
King Nereus was slain after a brief, but brutal fight with a rival dragon, Eteshkizan, who dwelled in a nearby volcanic archipelago. Ereshkizan feared retribution from The Dragon Gods, for striking a king anointed in their name, so he sank The Bronze Isle and placed powerful wards that prevented “any who breathe the air of the earth” from raising the palace again. Today, the twelve desolate islands of The Bronze Archipelago are all that remains of Nereus’ island kingdom.  
  

  

#####   
Hooks for The Lair of Nereus

- Your players have heard of a fantastical object that is located within Nereus’ final resting place.
    
- A tribe of merfolk, who believe Nereus to be an incarnation of their dread Lord Dagon, seek to raise Nereus from The Depths.
    
- A rival of Ereshkizan has hired your players to raise the temple, and find Nereus’ remains.
    
- A great earthquake near The Bronze Archipelago was detected by learned folks on the mainland. Your players have been sent to investigate, only to find that a great tower has been raised where there was previously an atoll.
    
- Your players must race to stop a cult from disturbing the remains of King Nereus.
    

  

Optional Adventure:

  

I have included a pair of maps with this dungeon that show both The Bronze Isle and The Bronze Archipelago. You could have your players go on an adventure to the barren islands of the archipelago, and battle the merfolk priests of Dagon that guard the keystones to Nereus’ lair. Once all of the keystones are gathered and brought to the atoll on the archipelago map, Nereus’ lair will rise from the depths. If you want to go hardmode, these keystones are all sunk in the sea around the archipelago, and have to be recovered by players that can (presumably) breathe water. The dungeon description I have included assumes that Nereus’ lair has already been raised from the depths.  
  

#### NPC Profile: Bronze King Nereus

As far as Dragonkings go, Nereus was mostly benevolent. His island kingdom maintained a stranglehold on all trade in this part of the ocean, and he charged exorbitant taxes, but he was not overly cruel to his subjects. He thought of himself as a glorious benefactor of the lesser races, and held a deeply condescending attitude towards most non-dragons (they simply don’t know any better; they are lucky to have my guidance). His greatest rival was a red dragon named Ereshkizan, who ruled a from an underwater volcano called “The Boiling Atoll”. This rivalry primarily manifested in trade wars and embargoes on their respective territories. HOwever, it eventually came to a head one day, when Ereshkizan sank a particularly loaded treasure galleon bound to pay a large sum of taxes to King Nereus. Nereus could not allow that slight to go unpunished, and the two dragons fought. Nereus later died of his wounds, after slingking back to his lair. Ereshkizan was maimed; he lost his left eye in the conflict, but he survived. Should Nereus’ spirit be contacted by your players, he will not necessarily realize that he has died. He may think that he is still resting in his palace, recovering from his wounds. He may see the merfolk as his loyal subjects who bring him tribute. However, if Nereus is confronted with evidence of the “human” sacrifices being done in his name, he is likely to realize that he is dead, and he will condemn the merfolk. He will beg the players to avenge him, and slay Ereshkizan.

# Approach

  

For the Players - “You can see the general outline of what must have once been a great tower. HOwever, the centuries beneath the sea have not been kind to the abode of King Nereus. Much of the great tower has crumbled beneath the weight of centuries. If the thick bed of coral growing atop the remains of the upper spire is anything to go by, then this ruin has been submerged a very, very long time.”  
  
For the DM - The Palace of Nereus was once a shining, white spire (not unlike an oversized spiraling, conch shell). However, the palace of Nereus was destroyed and sunk beneath the sea many centuries ago. Only a few rooms on the first floor have survived in any kind of explorable condition. Merfolk worshipped at this temple for centuries; drawn to the mystically clean and pure water that surrounded the sunken temple. Over the centuries, they came to view Nereus as an incarnation of their god, Dagon. They seek to serve “Dagon’s” will be raising this temple back to the surface, and bring Dagon to life. With the temple back at the surface, all they need to do now is complete the blood ritual that will breathe life into the coral-crusted bones that lie in the temple’s largest remaining chamber.  
  
  

# Entryway

For the Players - “A wide, silt-ridden staircase rises up from the beach, and into the outer sanctum of the temple. A fast-flowing stream cascades down the center of the stairs; the steps under this stream are worn smooth by the flow of water. A rank air of fish, rotting kelp and salt hangs in the air.”  
  
For the DM - This stream is fresh water, and creates difficult terrain on the stairs where it flows over them. The water is clean and pure; Nereus’ gift to this island. Inside of the temple, this flow of water is much faster, and deeper. Creatures with a swimming speed less than 30 should have great difficulty swimming upstream. Merfolk should have no problem navigating the streams, and using them to attack your players. Ambush from the streams should be difficult, as the water is uncommonly clean and clear. There should be no merfolk out on the steps of the temple. This place is out in the middle of nowhere; they are unconcerned with interruptions to their ritual.

  
  

# Outer Sanctum

  

For the Players - “There is a loud rushing sound of water in this room. The stream that flowed gently down the steps of the temple splits off and swirls away into four deep pools. A dozen or more merfolk are lounging in the pools. Six armed and stern-looking merfolk are standing at attention on either side of the stream as it flows out of a long hallway… At your approach, the lounging merfolk all spring to attention.”  
  
For the DM - Consult the included “Water Notes” map for information on which direction the water currents flow. Note that the two pools on the north side of the Outer Sanctum connect to underwater tunnels that lead into the West and East rooms, respectively. These tunnels are at the bottom of the pools, ~ 40 feet below the surface. Swimming down, through one of these tunnels and emerging inside the locked room should be a feat of uncommon or extreme athleticism, unless your player has a swim speed of at least 30.  
  
The merfolk have a small stockpile of weapons at the bottom of each of the four pools; razor sharp spears that are enchanted to never corrode or rust. Should your players claim these weapons, they are + 1 spears.  
  
Upon seeing your players, the dozen or so merfolk in the outer sanctum will scatter; four merfolk will split off and hide in the tunnels to the side rooms (two in each tunnel). The rest of the merfolk will dive to the bottom of the pools for their weapons.  
  
The six merfolk guarding the hallway to the Inner Sanctum will not leave their post, unless they see the fight going south. Should the fight turn in favor of your players, these six merfolk will confer in their native language. Three of the merfolk will dive into the water, and await your players in the underwater tunnel between The Inner Sanctum and The Coral Room. The other three merfolk will join the fight; targeting spellcasters first.  
  
  
  

# West Room

  

For the Players (approaching the door) - “You turn away from the chaos of the outer sanctum, and head down a wide hallway. The rushing of the water echoes down the pink stone hallway. The floor here is difficult to cross; patches of pink stone can be seen between a thick carpet of mollusks that have anchored themselves to the floor. The wickedly sharp bivalves threaten to slice apart the bare feet of any that cross this way… After crossing the treacherous clamshell floor, you find yourself standing before an incredibly crusted-over door. Salt and other minerals have taken their toll on this door; the fine artwork is unrecognizable. You try your hand at the door, but it stands firmly in place…. The door slowly swings open with a mighty creak that crashes through the ruin like a clap of thunder. Inside the room, you find several merfolk, and another small pool of extremely clear water… As the last merfolk falls, you notice a large wide brazier filled with blood. Clearly, you interrupted some strange blood rite of the merfolk.”

  

For the DM - Over the years, a thick mat of mussels, barnacles and scallops nestled in on the stone here. The floor is difficult terrain, even for those wearing boots. Anyone who does not wear armord boots should take a small amount of slashing damage for every 5 feet crossed, unless they find some way to mitigate the threat of the shelled creatures. If you wish to be especially cruel, you could have your player make dexterity saves to avoid falling on the sharp shells (and taking even more damage). The merfolk do not wear shoes; this should be a clue to your players that there is another way inside. There is no magical trick or trap holding this door shut; it has simply corroded into place. A high athletics check or strength save should be sufficient to open the door. Failing that, scrubbing the thick crust of minerals off of the door’s hinges, and oiling them, should make the door much easier to open. If your players force the door open with strength, the merfolk inside should be well aware of their attempts to enter. The merfolk in here are four guards (like the merfolk in the Outer Sanctum) and a Merfolk Priest of Dagon. The Priest of Dagon will be likely to target spellcaster or healers before anyone else; the guards will defend the priest with their lives. After two rounds of combat, the two merfolk hiding in the tunnel will leap out of the water and join the fray. If your players kill the priest, they may take his staff and his Amulet of Dagon; both of which are needed to open the door to the East Room. Should your players empty the brazier, they will find a pearl the size of a baseball at the bottom.

  

# East Room

For the Players - “You head east, and see that the floor here is similarly covered in a sharp, living carpet. However, there is a small, winding path that has been cleared through the creatures. Every now and then, there are spots where someone must have taken a misstep and crushed some of the creatures beneath their weight. Such spots are marked by thick, brown stains… The door to the room beyond is well-polished; the artwork depicts Nereus triumphantly feeding on a kraken that threatened his island… Upon touching the door, your hands are seized with pairn. You stumble backwards onto the sharp bivavles.”

  

For the DM - The Merfolk keep prisoners in the East Room. They regularly a narrow path through here, so that they can walk unharmed. However, they sometimes push their captives on to the sharp shells, causing their feet to get cut and hurt. Add a description of bloody humanoid footprints, if you like. The door is designed to cause psychic pain to anyone who tries to open it. Deal moderate amounts of psychic damage to players that attempt to open it without dispelling the wards, or wearing the merfolk priest's vestments. If a player takes psychic damage from the door, force them to make a constitution or dexterity save to avoid stumbling and falling on the sharp mussels. If a player wears the Amulet of Dagon and holds the merfolk priest’s staff, they should be able to open the door without any psychic pain. Inside of the room are several manacles that would chain a prisoner to the wall, but still allow a small amount of movement. You may populate this room with prisoners. If you’re feeling especially cruel, the manacles could have the same psychic damage enchantment as the door; stupefying and immobilizing the prisoners. Surviving prisoners should be able to tell your players about the sacrifices that the merfolk are performing in the hope that it pleases Dagon and awakens him from his eternal slumber. If your players make much noise in this room, they will alert the merfolk that have hidden themselves in the water tunnel below. The merfolk will leap out of the water, attack the players and attempt to shackle them to the wall.

  

# Inner Sanctum

For the Players - “The long hallway that leads from the outer sanctum to the inner sanctum is very well maintained, suggesting that the merfolk often walk along this path. The inner sanctum is dominated by a largem clear pond that feeds into the rushing creek. The pond is fed by a creek that is welling up from beneath a collapsed hallway. At the point where the eastern creek joins the pond, there is a crude stone archway bridge. The archway itself is covered in unreadable runes that dance and wriggle before your eyes. They almost make you forget about the thick, brown spatter that covers the apex of the archway.”

  

For the DM - The merfolk conduct blood rites to Dagon here. The captives are led to the archway bridge, and exsanguinated into the creek. Dagonic worshippers bathe in the unholy mix of blood and water that sweeps through the pond. Populate this room as you see fit; with a series of captives about to be sacrificed, or leave it chillingly empty, with a puddle of congealed blood on the archway. Note that if you decide to have a ritual in-progress, then the fight in the outer sanctum should go differently. (Screams and chanting should be audible. Red tinge to the water downstream from the ritual. Merfolk in the Outer Sanctum on edge.) To proceed into The Coral Room, your players will need to either find a way to move large amounts of rock, or dive down through the tunnel. Do not forget that there should be a few merfolk waiting to attack down in the underwater tunnel below the collapsed hallway. (If you decide to be merciful, you could say that the merfolk have a guide-rope system in the tunnel, so that they can easily transport captives/sacrifices into the most holy room of their temple. Otherwise, progress into The Coral Room should be tedious and difficult.)

  

#   
Coral Room

For the Players - “You emerge from the water, and suck in the stale air of the most inner sanctum. In the dim light, you can just make out the skeletal remains of an immense dragon. However, some of the bones seem ‘wrong’ in the flickering light; strange growths branch off the bones at odd angles. You do not have time to contemplate this wrongness, as the”  
  
For the DM - The Coral Room is the most sacred room in this temple. The massive remains of Nereus are here; over the centuries of submersion, they have been colonized by a variety of vividly colored coral specimens (Of course, your players will not see this unless they light the room somehow). Your description of the room is meant to be interrupted by whatever threat you decide to place here. There are a few things you can do in this room. You can have a High Priest of Dagon in the final steps of resurrecting Nereus. The dragon himself should be confused about being brought back to life, and will lash out at all around him. Alternatively, the priest of Dagon could simply command Nereus’ corpse as a puppet. Finally, you could have several priests of Dagon mid-ritual attempting to resurrect Nereus. Their ritual will fail, and the priests will blame your players (really though, it is because Nereus declined to be resurrected by the merfolk of Dagon). After the merfolk are cleared out of this room, and Nereus is put back to rest, his grateful spirit will appear before your players. He will grant each of them a large reward from his sunken treasures, and ask them to avenge him by killing the Red Terror, Ereshkizan.
