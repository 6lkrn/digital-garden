Spanning from 4 generations back, the Zhens not only has crystal mining to fall back on in [[Root/Worlds/Kathor/Locations/New Kunaan\|New Kunaan]]. The family is also the main provider for the country's military in the newly-developed firearms technology derived from a non-descript source. They utilise the crystals to power up their factories on top of lighting up their Residence that boasts 50 rooms and two grand halls for the family's need of ceremonies. The current Zhen family consist of four family members.

### History

The Imperial Family recognised the Zhen's craftsmanship in making their weapons and therefore assigned them the responsibility to provide for the country in that manner. In the preceding years, when firearms started being recognised as a weapon, the Zhens heavily invested in the technology. They starts monopolising the industry, being the leading family to provide for the country's militia and so far had shown no signs of stopping.
