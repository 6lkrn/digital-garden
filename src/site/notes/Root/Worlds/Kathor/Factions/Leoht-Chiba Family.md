The Leoht-Chiba Family, as the name goes is a family made from the unification of the Leoht Family and the Chiba Family. The family had kept their fame and fortune up to the 6th generation. It started with the family business of fortune telling and gradually branched to trading grains. 

The Leoht and the Chiba family first only had hands together for business matters--until the third generation. 

[[Root/Worlds/PCs/Chiba Suzume\|Chiba Suzume]] and [[Root/Worlds/Kathor/NPCs/Raion Leoht\|Raion Leoht]] fell in love with each other and brought both families' unification to a more intimate level.
