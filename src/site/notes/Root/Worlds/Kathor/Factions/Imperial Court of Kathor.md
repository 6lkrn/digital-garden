The emperor is the descendant of a recent warlord that conquered much of the known world. The conqueror dealt with the new lands by incorporating the conquered nobility into their own empire. Allowing them to keep their titles and lands kept the nobles loyal to their new emperor. The nobles help enforce the empire's rule over the many peoples and lands throughout the planet. In return for this, they enjoy a luxurious lifestyle that most people can only dream of.

The Emperor requires that one member of each noble family be present in the capital city, under the Emperor’s control. This person helps represent their family’s interests while also serving as a hostage to keep the nobles in check. The Empire has spent almost 500 years in constant warfare, leading to them running out of manpower and resources and being forced to turn over a lot of power to the nobles and the Company.

The Court is made up of the Imperial family and its branches. All important family members have important positions in the branches of government. The structure of the government ensures that the imperial family holds a tight control over the core functions of the Empire. Unfortunately the nepotism has slowly lead to the growth of corruption and incompetence.

The Emperor wants to restore absolute power though he must be careful not to upset the delicate balance.
