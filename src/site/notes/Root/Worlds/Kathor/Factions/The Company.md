They started off as a small group of merchants that bought the contract to colonise the islands but they have slowly grown to be one of the strongest [[factions\|factions]] in the empire. They land they had purchased from the empire had seemed inconsequential at first, until the empire learned about the crystals that lay below the wild islands.

As they control the supply of all crystals from the unexplored islands, they have a lot of influence. This influence has only grown as the empires other sources of crystals diminish.

The emperor is concerned with how strong the company has gotten and the imperial court is watching their every move very closely. Even a sign of weakness would give the empire reason to step in and finally take control of the coveted crystal mines.

The company does very little of the mining itself, preferring to allow minor merchants and nobles to do all the dirty work. Instead they focus their resources on building up their powerful navy and gaining and training valuable “agents”.

Company men are taught to train the Company as Family and are ingrained into the culture from a young age. These men go on to retire with hefty pensions and land grants on the islands. Even in retirement these men do the company’s bidding, the wealth they had gained in the company's employ providing them with the means to enter high society. The retired sailors and foot soldiers provide a trained and loyal force that live upon the colonised island and are able to be called up at a moment's notice.

The Company has been slowly gaining influence and control over the nobles and merchants of the empire. They control much of the trade in the empire and have a navy that rivals the imperial navy.

The true owner of the Company and their end goals are still unknown.
