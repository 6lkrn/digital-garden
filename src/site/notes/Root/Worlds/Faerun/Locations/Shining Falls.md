(Source: *Storm King’s Thunder*, page 107)

Originally a deer trail portage along the Delimbiyr River, now it’s a vital part of the expanded [[Root/Worlds/Faerun/Locations/Delimbiyr Road\|Delimbiyr Road]], and a point of contention: Do we expand the river and dig up a lock system, or just leave it be? Expect the Alliance or the Gauntlet to have some suggestions while the Enclave wishes to keep the falls the way it is. Intrigue.
