**Micro-Worldbuilding Opportunities:** None of the campaigns in my pile of reference material touch this massive tower, but I still find use for this. With its proximity with [[Root/Worlds/Faerun/Locations/Ardeep Forest\|Ardeep Forest]], the [[Root/Worlds/Faerun/Locations/Dancing Dell\|Dancing Dell]], and the Floshin Estate, the House of Stone can be used as a meeting place between the Elves and the other [[Races\|races]]—especially dwarves—where treaties and negotiations can be held.

Of course, they have to clear it of all the undead and monsters that dwell in it first. It does have a dungeon after all.
