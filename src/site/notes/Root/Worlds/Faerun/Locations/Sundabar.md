Every campaign setting worth its salt will have their differences between Dwarves and Elves, and all campaign settings from Wizards of the Coast are ur-examples. A good example of this is how those two go racist on you: Elves go Racist, they lash out. When Dwarves go Racist, they hunker down in their holes, lock the door, and put out a “GTFO” mat in front of it.

Such is the case in Sundabar. The only dwarves that ever peek out of the surface are the ones keeping watch for anyone who wanders into the ruined city, with more than one weapon trained on whoever doesn’t get the point and turn tail.

The Dwarves here don’t go and build any super-weapon to terrorize the world around them. I leave that for the [[[../../../Creatures/NPCs/Non Player Characters/Eldreth Valuuthra\|Eldreth Valuuthra]]. But they would create a defensive weapon that could fall into the wrong hands, which could force Sundabar to reopen its doors to the outside world.

Such an example would be the discovery of *White Plume Mountain* which is found not too far from Sundabar. Wave, Whelm, and Blackrazor (The three intelligent [[Campaign Resources/Equipment/Weapons/Weapons\|weapons]] in the *Dungeon Master’s Guide*) were more myth than legend before the dungeon was discovered, and they need to do a bit of research to figure out what they’re dealing with. Not only do they not want the [[Campaign Resources/Equipment/Weapons/Weapons\|weapons]] to fall into the wrong hands, but some Dwarves from Sundabar feared that the [[Campaign Resources/Equipment/Weapons/Weapons\|weapons]] would corrupt them into becoming no better than the [[Root/Worlds/Other worlds/NPCs/Eldreth Valuuthra\|Eldreth Valuuthra]]. So some of them dared to do the unthinkable: They left for the [[Human\|human]] world to ask for help.
