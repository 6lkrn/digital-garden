The High Moor might be the main motivation for the [[Eldreth Veluuthra\|Eldreth Veluuthra]], who wishes this kingdom returned and restored to its ‘proper’ form. Of course, they believe that it was the non-elven races that caused this cataclysm (which was lost to history. If you ask me, you can blame a meteorite.) A good number of [[Eldreth Veluuthra\|Eldreth Veluuthra]] folk till talk of transforming the Moor, which might result in a lot of schemes, several campaign running at once, and a whole lot of dead non-elves.
