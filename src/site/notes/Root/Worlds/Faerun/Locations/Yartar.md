If Waterdeep is the Forgotten Realms answer to New York, then here is Faerun's Las Vegas.

By the time you see the many brothels and gambling halls in this town, including one where the girls are in cursed Bunny Girl outfits[<sup>\[1\]</sup>](C:/Users/David/Documents/Fox Forgot Realm/01/Text Input FFR 01.docm#_ftn1), the party should have no illusions. They stumbled into Toril's City of Sin, where the DM—me—has designated as the one place where he can put in his kinks. If you value your family friendliness of your campaign, avoid Yatar.

There is a thieves guild, the [Hand of Yartar](onenote:People.one#[[Root/Worlds/Faerun/Factions/The Hand of Yartar\|The Hand of Yartar]]&section-id={210805A3-74F6-4D63-B08E-AFDF9616CA18}&page-id={4005CEEF-D58F-4D63-9B64-DD4279631DAE}&end&base-path=https://d.docs.live.net/e21b9e20e83c1882/Documents/Foxfire Forgotten Realms), that not only consists of all women; not only consists of all women wearing enchanted tuxedo showgirl outfits; not only consists of all woman wearing enchanted tuxedo showgirl outfits run by succubi; but also consists of an all women wearing enchanted tuxedo outfits run by succubi that has a spell that changes people's gender and has cursed outfits that turn their victims into sex workers!

[[Root/Worlds/Faerun/Factions/The Hand of Yartar\|The Hand of Yartar]] has already crashed one campaign, and this is created by someone who wouldn't touch The Tomb of Facking Horrors!

If there's anyone you heard about who accused me of having “My Soggy Knees,” it's because of Yatar. However, having a bunch of all-female heroes take town the Hand in their home town would make for a grand adventure, and one that would be much more inclusive than its surface image.

Unfortunately, some of the campaigns have business in Yartar.

**[[Campaign Resources/Magic/Spells/Teleportation Circle\|Teleportation Circle]]:** Fortunately for the [[Root/Worlds/Faerun/Factions/Harpers\|Harpers]], Kolbaz is too cantankerous for [[Root/Worlds/Faerun/Factions/The Hand of Yartar\|the Hand of Yartar]] to even touch. Only in my version, the illusion is flipped. The *[[Campaign Resources/Magic/Spells/Hallucinatory Terrain\|hallucinatory terrain]]* shows the broken benches, weed-infested flowerbeds, and shattered statues. Once through the illusion, you find the pristine version waiting for you, surrounding that circle. The spell is set into a series of gemstones that Kobalz can turn on and off with a switch. It beats having to renew the spell every day.

 

[<sup>\[1\]</sup>](C:/Users/David/Documents/Fox Forgot Realm/01/Text Input FFR 01.docm#_ftnref1) If you want to know more about these cursed costumes, I’m only going to guide you to Æthercoil Magazine. There’s only so much I should say here in the Dungeon Masters Guild.
