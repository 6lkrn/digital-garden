*The Forge of Fury* will be placed here. The Miner Union will discover Khundrukar as they explore another site to mine. Of course, they will discover the Many-Arrows Orcs using it to stage another raid to the mines at first, followed up by apeshit insane and angry Druggar Dwarves deeper inside. It takes a lot for a [[Dwarf\|Dwarf]] to ask for help, but Moradin damn it, Khundrukar succeeded.
