**Recycled Artifact Site:** This is a site where a Giant Relic was stored, and the same scenario and encounter can be used for any artifact that you’ll find useful in your campaign. I will use it for a piece of [[Root/Resources/Equipment/Weapons/The Rod of Seven Parts\|the Rod of Seven Parts]] here.
