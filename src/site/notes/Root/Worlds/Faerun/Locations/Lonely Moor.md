**Micro-Worldbuilding Opportunities:** Looking at it on the map, it's a bit too north to be related to the secretive Elven village of Everska. But I just remembered something from an earlier homemade campaign I set near here.

I designed up an ancient kingdom that was lost in a major planeshift, only to have it reappear over a maw that was present in 4th Edition Faerun, north of [[Root/Worlds/Faerun/Locations/Parnast\|Parnast]]. It might not have been part of Ancient Faerun, but it didn't have to be, just have it overlay over some missing part of the realm.

I might bring that idea back, only have it overlay the Lonely Moor.
