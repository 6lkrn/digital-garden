This is an important meeting place for the Emerald Enclave, and such if the party ever had an important meeting with the Faction, there’s a good chance that they’ll wish to hold the meeting here. The tenant Turlang takes care of the place and makes sure that unwelcome visitors are kept out, which is pretty much par for the [[Root/Worlds/Faerun/Locations/High Forest\|High Forest]]. Turlang’s modified stat block is included here.
