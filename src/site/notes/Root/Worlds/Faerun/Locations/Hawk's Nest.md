The Suggested Encounter doesn't really need to be Fire Giants and Hell Hounds if they’re not appropriate. You can toss in another group of baddies, such as the [[Eldreth Veluuthra\|Eldreth Veluuthra]], or [[Root/Worlds/Faerun/Factions/House Xorlarrin\|House Xorlarrin]], or some Barbarian Group. Whatever works.
