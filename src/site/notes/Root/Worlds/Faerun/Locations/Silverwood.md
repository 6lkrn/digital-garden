If there was any reason why the [[Root/Worlds/Other worlds/NPCs/Eldreth Valuuthra\|Eldreth Valuuthra]] exists, they’d just point at Silverwood, and what those who aren’t them have done with it. Of course, that was before people learned how to make tree farms, and there’s the need for a road around the [[Root/Worlds/Faerun/Locations/Evermoors\|Evermoors]], but don’t let something as insignificant as *centuries of mankind progressing along the Evolutionary path* get in the way of vilifying some farmer or hunter trying to make a living, right?
