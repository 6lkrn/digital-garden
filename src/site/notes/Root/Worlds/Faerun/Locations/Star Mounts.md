(source: *Storm King’s Thunder,* page 109)

**Micro-Worldbuilding Opportunities:** Reading the description in this entry, especially at the chaotic weather at its peak, got me to thinking about an entry in *Volo’s Guide to [[Monsters\|Monsters]]*. Storm Giants, when they’re in their dying years, choose to transform themselves into a living storm, a form of transcendence called a Quintessent. I have my guess that such a creature is on top of this mountain, far beyond its mortal coil but still existing.
