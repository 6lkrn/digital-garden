Why do I think of Power Rock Super Group Avantasia when I get to this area? Must be that ghostlights (called witchlights in the book) that float around here. I smell opportunity here.

**Micro-Worldbuilding Opportunities**: Due to the amount of ruins and abandoned battlegrounds, there’s plenty of places to plug in a dungeon or tomb. And it’s close enough to the [[Root/Worlds/Faerun/Locations/Far Forest\|Far Forest]] region to be a part of my *Against the Giants* campaign.
