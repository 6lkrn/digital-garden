**Major City**: [[Root/Worlds/Faerun/Locations/Neverwinter\|Neverwinter]] will be a good city for the party to rest up, restock supplies, upgrade [[Root/Resources/Equipment/Shopping/Trade Goods\|equipment]], and so on.

**Micro-Worldbuilding Opportunities:** I see the City of Sails not just a pirate town vying for a place in the grown-ups table that is the [[Lord’s Alliance\|Lord’s Alliance]] (Thanks to [[Root/Worlds/Faerun/NPCs/Jarlaxle Baenre\|Jarlaxle Baenre]]) but I also see some wizards in the Arcane Brotherhood dabble in science and create a major invention or two that will shake the whole realms. If there’s anything from the real world that will slip into this campaign world, chances are that it’ll appear from Luskan. This will definitely be a help in Luskan’s appeal for the Alliance

In fact, I’m moving one cannon character from *Storm King’s Thunder* to here to improve the city’s image: [[Root/Worlds/Faerun/NPCs/Thwip Ironbottom\|Thwip Ironbottom]] from Hundelstone (Pages 91-92). He’s an Artificer (Using the Unearthed Arcana source) and a Harper, originally connected with Beldora in Icewind Dale. Since the region wasn’t touched until much later in my runs there, where the party took out Svardborg, I decided to move him to a place that will do him some good. In Luskan, he can keep an eye on the ship companies and the Arcane Brotherhood, and use his time there to construct something that a rock [[Gnome\|gnome]] would really use: An Eberron-style Iron Defender.
