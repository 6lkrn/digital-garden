**Micro-Worldbuilding Opportunities**: Evermoor Way is a road that could use some improvements, with a stretch that hangs too close to the [[Root/Worlds/Faerun/Locations/Evermoors\|Evermoors]] and "The Stump Yard" where the road cuts through a forest. Since the leaders of [[Root/Worlds/Faerun/Locations/Yartar\|Yartar]] and [[Root/Worlds/Faerun/Locations/Everlund\|Everlund]] can't get on the same page on the matter, maybe a group of heroes might move in and improve it themselves. Not only is there a possibility for some inter-city Intrigue, there is also the matter of dealing with the trials, tribulations, swamp encounters, and hassles with treefolk that goes with changing that road by any means.
