The Encounter can be altered, but still used. Those two lovebirds, Albie and Leshonna, could be running toward any goblinoid party, or orcs and ogres, hill giants, or…heh heh heh, warring families.

The Grizlows and Daars would be warring like the Hatfields and McCoys, and these two are the Romeo and Juliet of this feud. The party would either find out about the battle from the two themselves, or from the two families who demand that the two apeshit insane kids come back and kill each other. Like they're supposed to be doing!

I can make either angle, or both. Depends on what kind of parties I have on the table.
