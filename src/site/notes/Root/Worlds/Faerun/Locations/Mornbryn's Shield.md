The Giant problem might have been dealt with earlier, but the [[Root/Worlds/Faerun/Factions/Zhentarim\|Zhentarim]] still has their presence here. [[Mornbryn’s Shield\|Mornbryn’s Shield]] is one of their safehouses, and you can assume that the villagers here are Zhents in hiding.

**Micro-Worldbuilding Opportunities**: They do not know about [[Mornbryn’s tomb\|Mornbryn’s tomb]], however, but the Harpers do, and the latter group would want to have a group of adventures quietly search for that tomb and plunder its contents before the Zhents catch wise. For what purpose? Well, that's the matter for another campaign creation.
