There are two quests that can be placed here. The first one is from *Storm King’s Thunder*. The “Adventurers Wanted” sign may lead to another tower, or another Hill Giant encounter, or even another Hill Giant encounter located in another tower. The Tower can be a lookout tower that needs to be reclaimed, a Mission House that fell into trouble, or a Wizard’s Tower that may or may not be occupied.

The other quest comes from *Volo’s Guide to the North*. In Elminister’s footnotes, there is a doppelganger who is slaying merchants, the party might find a missing person’s notice, and while asking around, they discuss the matter with [[Blasko Malamar\|Blasko Malamar]] in his Stable. One of his stablehands will want to talk to the party because he has a clue to the missing person’s whereabouts. When the party follows this stablehand, he reveals himself as the doppelganger and attacks the party. I will design a module for this quest in Issue 2.
