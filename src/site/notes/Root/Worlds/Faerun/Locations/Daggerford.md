Suffice it to say that I won’t have [[Root/Worlds/Faerun/NPCs/Pencheska\|Pencheska]] usurping the [[Root/Worlds/Faerun/NPCs/Duchess Morwen\|Duchess Morwen]]’s identity in this setting. That’s because I’ll be remixing *Scourge of the Sword Coast* into this setting as one of the first campaigns here, and I’ll be needing [[Root/Worlds/Faerun/NPCs/Morwen\|Morwen]] in her ruling position.

[[Root/Worlds/Faerun/NPCs/Pencheska\|Pencheska]], who everyone save for three people in the village sees as the proverbial “Whore with the Heart of Gold” who is running the [[Root/Worlds/Caermor/Locations/Chaia/Silver Flood Inn\|Silver Flood Inn]] (and Brothel). She’s untethered by any devil or demon here, and such just wishes to live free among the mortals (whom she finds as a whole lot of fun, not to mention substance.)

The [[Root/Worlds/Faerun/Locations/Lizard Marsh\|Lizard Marsh]]  quest has been changed as well, taking a chapter from *Ghosts of Dragonspear Castle*.

The Happy Cow remains as written in *Storm King’s Thunder*, which includes the part about a tower in [[Root/Worlds/Faerun/Locations/Orlbar\|Orlbar]] that people can just take up and move in. This might be an award for those who go through the *Dreams of the Red Wizards* stoyline.
