As part of the [[Root/Worlds/Faerun/Locations/High Road\|High Road]] across from the [[Root/Worlds/Faerun/Locations/Mere of Dead Men\|Mere of Dead Men]], any campaign party can find a warm and dry—if not pleasant smelling—place to stay for the night here. It comes more into play when the party starts to devote into the swamp, and [[Root/Worlds/Faerun/Locations/Naerythar Castle\|Naerythar Castle]], which will be overhauled in this setting.
