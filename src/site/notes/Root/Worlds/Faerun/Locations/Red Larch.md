# Red Larch 

(Sources: *Storm King’s Thunder,* Page 106; *Princes of the Apocalypse*)

This village takes center stage in the *Princes of the Apocalypse* storyline, and will do again when I rework it. My version of Red Larch takes place after the previous stint through the module. The Believers were routed out by the village’s newest burgomaster, the arch-wizard [[Meriele Ambercrowns\|Meriele Ambercrowns]].

Merielle took over running the place after she discovered that the Believers killed her mentor, Yather Indaglol, who was the reclusive proprietor of The Helm at Highsun.

[[Root/Worlds/Faerun/NPCs/Marlandro Gaelkur\|Marlandro Gaelkur]], [[Root/Worlds/Other worlds/NPCs/Albaeri Mellikho\|Albaeri Mellikho]], and [[Root/Worlds/Faerun/NPCs/Ilmeth Waelvur\|Ilmeth Waelvur]] all received a proper punishment and was turned to stone, Ilmeth was turned into a fountain in the center of town, where the sinkhole was, and Albaeri was dressed up in a garish clown outfit before she was petrified, forced to pose in an unflattering way for people to use as a urinal. Marlandro is used to point to the rear entrance of the Moving Rocks dungeon, now converted into a museum for the “[[Root/Worlds/Faerun/Locations/Temple of the Elements\|Temple of the Elements]],” displaying not only its history but also information on the [[Root/Worlds/Faerun/Factions/Four Elemental Cults\|Four Elemental Cults]] that are still at large.

**Micro-Worldbuilding Opportunities**: Red Larch is the home base for any excursion to the [[Root/Worlds/Faerun/Locations/Temple of the Elements\|Temple of the Elements]], but it can also be a home base to any other campaign in the Dessarin Area. The village has plenty of houses for adventurers to call home.
