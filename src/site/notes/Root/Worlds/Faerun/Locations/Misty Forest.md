Another mysterious forest, another group of wood elves protecting the place from non-elves…another group that can be infected by the [[Root/Worlds/Other worlds/NPCs/Eldreth Valuuthra\|Eldreth Valuuthra]]. In fact, with its proximity with [[Root/Worlds/Faerun/Locations/Daggerford\|Daggerford]] and [[Root/Worlds/Faerun/Locations/Mount Illifran\|Mount Illifran]], there's a good chance that the group might have a place there already, which has a hand over what is happening during *Scourge of the Sword Coast.*
