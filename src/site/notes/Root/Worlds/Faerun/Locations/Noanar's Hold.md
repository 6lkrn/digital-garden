**Micro-Worldbuilding Opportunities:** I'm surprised that nobody has put up a more detailed adventure about Noanar's Hold in the Dungeon Masters Guild yet. Or they had and I haven’t found it yet. Or they had after I typed up this entry; stranger stuff has happened. Whatever the reason, it’s something I intend to rectify with this magazine.
