Hmm a scry-proof forest. Is there anyone other than me who thinks that this Forest has become the National Headquarters of the [[[../../../Creatures/NPCs/Non Player Characters/Eldreth Valuuthra\|Eldreth Valuuthra]]. I almost expect to see something out of a White Supremacist episode of *Gangland* in that forest.
