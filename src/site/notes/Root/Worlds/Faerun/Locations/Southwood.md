**Micro-Worldbuilding Opportunities:** A rare event in Faerun: A quiet forest to live in. I see the Hunters and Rangers here focus on its conservation as well as making sure that the [[Root/Worlds/Other worlds/NPCs/Eldreth Valuuthra\|Eldreth Valuuthra]] claim it as their own. I could see a campaign where the [[Elvish\|elvish]] supremacists try to take over the region, claiming it as part of their woods. (They’d believe that every tree is *theirs*, of course.) And the party members has to drive the pointy-eared Nazis away.
