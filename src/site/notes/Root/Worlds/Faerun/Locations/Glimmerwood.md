Since these three forests has merged into a single location, I'm going to treat it as such. The Fire Giants slashing through the eastern section (for overworld travel) didn't sit well with the wood [[Elf\|elf]] and barbarian locals, although Yakfolk kept them away. The possible [[Drow\|drow]] influence I'm adding here won't make things any better. So, things are on edge.

Glimmerwood is also a good place for a [[Eldreth Veluuthra\|Eldreth Veluuthra]] location, so that's another angle. If you use that, they'll be more into the southern part of the Glimmerwood. (Moonwood to the locals.)
