**Micro-Worldbuilding Opportunities:** Not only is there a useful—and very friendly, at least by Dwarven standards—[[Dwarf\|Dwarf]] village, there’s also the possibility of having a bunch of stargazers here. If there’s any celestial events in Faerun, you can bet that there’s a lot of scholars camping here with rows of telescopes set up, not to mention an observatory or two.

And then there’s a possible meteorite making landfall there, with some alien metal to use for a weapon…or some alien life for that matter. I don’t have illithids in my homebrew campaign worlds, but if there’s an alien race that I’d like to playtest, it’ll probably be first seen here.
