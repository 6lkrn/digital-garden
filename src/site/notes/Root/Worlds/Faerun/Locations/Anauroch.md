This is formerly [[Root/Worlds/Faerun/Locations/Netheril\|Netheril]], before the [[Root/Worlds/Caermor/Factions/Shade Enclave\|Shade Enclave]] was defeated during the Sundering era. Most of the region has fallen into desert, while a glacier is pushing south from the Northern Reaches. It wouldn’t be unsurprising to find a [[Frost Giant\|Frost Giant]] in the colder area, which is why I’m planning to place the Frost Giant chapter of *Against the Giants* there, as near as I can to the [[Root/Worlds/Faerun/Locations/Far Forest\|Far Forest]].

**Micro-Worldbuilding Opportunities**: Anauroch also has an assortment of ghost towns and abandoned temples, keeps, and dungeons about, any of which can be a place to put in a homemade dungeon for whatever reason. Whether it’s to find something important in Anauroch history, or to find the lost plans for [[Airships\|airships]], or even place in *The Tomb of Fucking Horrors* if the party really pisses me off enough.
