**Micro-Worldbuilding Opportunities**: Having a quest to find a member of the Icespear family to take up Deadsnows would be a great quest. Maybe to find an orphaned dwarf that doesnâ€™t know his heritage (and possibly wandering around Faerun without a goal, to coincide with the deity mentioned in this entry). Or maybe even have a party member who has ties to the Icespear and would want to take Deadsnows as his own.

This adventure might even lead to a campaign where the rejuvenated Icespear clan finds the lost technology to rebuild [[Airships\|airships]], revolutionizing travel across the Realms and starting competition with the Elves. Who can make a better airship?
