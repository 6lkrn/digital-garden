Waterdeep, known as the City of Splendors, lies on the southwestern edge of the North. 

The population rarely falls below 122,000, though the actual number varies seasonally. In times of busy trade, the city hosts five times this number. Almost every surface-dwelling race has representatives here, though most are Northern humans. Elves, gnomes, and dwarves dwell here, but the [[Halfling\|Halfling]] population grows annually, promising to become the largest demi-[[Human\|Human]] race in residence. To match the racial variety, most religions have shrines or temples. Anything one could want can be found in this mighty seaport. 

The militia, thought to be 1,200 Guards (heavily trained, fully armoured soldiers) and 1,600 Watch (light-armoured policemen) may search any person, place, or container without hindrance or warning. The city is massive, spanning over 15 square miles. Navigating through the streets from one end of town to the other can take a full day, if not longer. The city is broken up into multiple districts, called wards, each surrounded by tall walls and bottlenecked by doors, where the guards can stop and search suspicious individuals. 

The town does not have a king or mayor, but is instead ran by the “[[Root/Worlds/Faerun/Factions/Lords of Waterdeep\|Lords of Waterdeep]]” A secret council of somewhere between 50 and 80 members. When in public they wear long, identical robes and large, identical metal helmets to conceal their identity. They very rarely show themselves in public, and when they do, it’s always in groups of 4, and one of them is always the “Open Lord” [[Root/Worlds/Faerun/NPCs/Dagult Neverember\|Dagult Neverember]]. The [[Root/Worlds/Faerun/Factions/Open Lord of Waterdeep\|Open Lord of Waterdeep]] is the sole member of the [[Root/Worlds/Faerun/Factions/Lords of Waterdeep\|Lords of Waterdeep]] whose identity is publicly known. There is only one Open Lord at any one time, but when the previous one dies or steps down, he or she is replaced by a new one.

Your story begins on the holiday “[[Lliira’s Night\|Lliira’s Night]]”, which happens every year on the 7th of Flamerule. This nightlong festival honours the Lady of Joy with dances and Balls held throughout the city. The [[Cynosure Ball\|Cynosure Ball]] is the highlight of the night, sponsored jointly by the Lords, the local clergy of [[Root/Worlds/Faerun/NPCs/Lliira\|Lliira]] and various noble families. It is held at [[Root/Worlds/Faerun/Factions/The Cynosure\|The Cynosure]], a temple in the castle ward, with a long and interesting history. It is most known for the remnants of an ancient spell which causes all spell casters to struggle to cast even the most simple of spells, and thus is used as a kind of neutral ground for meetings between powerful mages, or in this case a safe haven for a ball without fear of magical attacks or interruptions. The main banquet hall is lavishly decorated, and the large, open room is filled with nobility and other important figures. At one end of the room is a double set of stairs leading up to a platform where the Open Lord and several other members of importance sit. At the other end of the room is a large stage where a traveling band of musicians who arrived just for this occasion set the mood with epic ballads and famous dancing tunes.  Suddenly, black plumes of smoke appear in various spots all across the room, and from each one steps a warrior dressed in full black leather armor, each wielding a pure black katana. They do not immediately attack but instead shout for everyone to drop to the floor. Multiple appear up on the balcony and are engaged in combat with the guards and nobility. The Open Lord Neverember is slain before your eyes, after which the figures shout in an unknown language to each other and each disappears in a plume of black smoke

Party met at the ball, did not fight mysterious attackers, watched open lord neverember get murdered. Streets were locked down and party forced into an inn. They searched for clue all day but found nothing. They read a flyer posted to a random pole from former lord piergeiron and decided to help him stop the thief xanathar. They needed a way into skullport so they ventured to the dock ward and propositioned a fishing boat for passage up the river sargauth. The fisherman told them that was suicide if you weren’t already a member of one of the many thieves guilds present in skullport. Armyn had a shady connection from his time as a thug they were able to convince to let them into the lowest level of skullport via a secret portal he had hidden in a backroom. On their way into the piss bucket tavern they were mugged by 4 bandits. They defeated the bandits and took one prisoner. They successfully intimidated him and gained access to a rickety pully system that brought them up to the central level. They spoke to a prostitute who told them they had to be invited to the “upper heart” where the crookspar parlor was located. They went to The High Tide Tavern and began flashing coin around, and were noticed by a high roller parlor employee, who told them about a big game starting the next day with a 20g buy in. The party rested for the night, and prepared to infiltrate the heart of the thieves guild operation in hopes of finding and stopping the famous thief Xanathar.
Upon awaking the next day, the party is escorted to the crookspar parlor, where they are questioned heavily while waiting for a game. There will be 16 players total, one of them will be the ranger Mos Deth, the other 3 PC’s and 12 NPCs. Of the 12 NPC’s, 6 are from The Mandibles, 2 from the Reforged Ring, 3 from the Riverborn, and 1 is an agent of the Eye. The EyE will be acting completely wasted but is infact totally sober, and a powerful actor (everyone roll perception checks, perfect roll notices)
CRAPS: Everyone chooses “life” or “death”. A roller is chosen at random and rolls the “come-out” roll. If it is a 2, 3 or 12, then it is considered “crapping out” and death bets win. If it is 7 or 11, the roll is “natural” and life bets win. Otherwise, the roller will keep rolling the dice attempting to try to get that number again before they roll a 7. If they do, life wins, if they don’t, death wins. Winners get a point, losers get nothing. The first half of the group to get 3 points moves on to the next round, the other half is eliminated and loses their buy in. If more than half get to 3 points at the same time, everyone will roll and the top rolls move on. 
The agent of the eye is wielding a katana. He obtained the device by killing an unusual swordsman many years ago. The blade is not black. If one of the players win, they will be brought to the back room to get paid. If they request it, the rest of the party can come with. In the back room is [[Root/Worlds/Other worlds/NPCs/Alauneth\|Alauneth]] “the Black Viper” Orrane who will offer them the quest citadel of the bloody hand with a reward of 100 gold each. If they lose, the party can still obtain the quest by asking around for information about xanathar. She will pull them into the back room and tell the party that an enemy of an enemy is a friend and will offer the quest in exchange for information.
If the party was too suspicious while nearby the Eye agent, they will be ambushed by 5 thieves after leaving the parlor. The katana wielding agent will be present but will run if he is the last alive, or takes lots of damage. This will earn the party a bad reputation in skull port and make future trips more difficult.
The party arrived in Crookspar parlor, and was escorted to the back room without exploring. They were questioned heavily by the drunk player, and told him they were friends with Xanathar and suspiciously refused to answer any questions. They competed in the craps tournament, and Irridian made it to the grand finals. She was defeated by Snapperton, an older, retired pirate, who the party did not speak to or question. He was escorted to a upper floor to speak with “the black viper”, and shortly after, Irridian was asked to speak with her as well. She requested the party come along with her. They went into the back room and met with the black viper, who said the tournament was designed to find an adventurer with lady luck on their side, and asked them to help her clear out her groups former stronghold, the citadel of the bloody hand. The party did not ask what the name of her organization is or what role she plays. The black viper said the most common entrance to the undermountain was via the yawning portal inn, a very old and famous establishment with a deep well in the back that led to the first level of the undermountain: the dungeon level. Once they arrived at the yawning portal inn they were greeted by the local bard who offered to set them up with a mysterious woman who could sell them a map. He seemed to know very little about the woman but seemed insistent the party met with her to buy a map. The party did not question him further. They descended into the well in the back and into the dungeon level of the undermountain. They made it to the hall of many pillars and felt their magical power fade but did not investigate. They left through the unmarked passage and into the hall of shattered mirrors where they were attacked by a ghostly skeleton from one mirror, and other was a mimic in disguise. Around the corner they found a victim of the mimic and shattered the mirror used by the mimic to make a copy. They moved into the next area and found a huge chasm with a small rope bridge spanning it. They set up camp for the night and took a long rest. 
The party used the rope bridge to cross the chasm, but was attacked by two darkmantles. Irridian used [[Levitate\|Levitate]] to avoid walking on the rope bridge. Armyn found a portion of the rope bridge frayed and made it across first. Irridian and Mosdeth took down the two darkmantles. They made it across, checked the fray, and pulled up a heavily armed [[Elf\|Elf]], who had a shortbow, a longsword, 100 gold and a steel shield. Armyn took the shield and sword, Mosdeth took the bow, the party split the gold and left the chainmail. Suddenly, two dark mysterious figures descending from the ceiling, trapped Irridian in a net, and disappeared into a magical trap hole in the roof of the cave in the blink on an eye. The party moved forwards and found the tunnel narrow down a bit into a pool of tar. Ethos noticed they had set off an [[Campaign Resources/Magic/Spells/Alarm\|Campaign Resources/Magic/Spells/Alarm]] spell moving into this area, but didn’t know who set it or where it came from. They also felt like they were being watched. The party thought long and hard about how to proceed, and when reaching down to touch the surface, a dread appeared and attacked. After defeating the dread they moved through the tar unhindered, still feeling like they were being watched. At the end of this section they began searching for traps or secrets and found a loose stone. They pulled on the stone but nothing happened. They pushed the stone in and it was a secret switch that activated a trap door. Inside was a huge dwarven statue that magically told them to leave. The party proceeded past it and found a crypt that had been looted and two more dreads attacked. After clearing them out, they found a large door, and a smaller door. They chose the smaller door, which lead to a T intersection. Going south, Armyn fell right into a pit fall. He climbed out with a rope held by Mosdeth and Ethos, but tried to jump over it and fell right back in. He was pulled out again, and they fires a rope arrow that somehow magically ties itself around a torch holder. They were able to use this rope to cross the pit fall. On the other side, they found that the hall way was magical and they would make no progress running down it. They could not figure out how to dispel it. They turned around and went to the other path on the T, and found a huge ornate room with a giant tapestry depicting dwarves fighting a huge white dragon. After exploring the room, two magical skeletons appeared from behind the tapestry, shooting magic missiles and blinking around the room. After defeating them, they entered the secret room behind the tapestry and found Brainburn, an intelligent giant skull surrounded by green flames. He told them to leave, but could not force them to. They disregarded him and scared him off. They explored the room and found a crypt with a young, fresh dead [[Dwarf\|Dwarf]] in it, and a mirror with an enchantment making it look like an empty room. They stepped through the mirror and found themselves in a small alcove filled with treasure. Inside you found:
1000 gold, +1 staff, +1 longbow, +1 mace, ring of initiative (+2), Steel Shield with Emblem of Torm, splint mail, scale mail, Rod of Force, scroll of [[Fireball\|Fireball]]
17 ornamental gems ( moss agate; azurite; bloodstone; carnelian; chalcedony; chrysoprase; citrine; hematite; iolite; jasper; lapis lazuli; malachite; moonstone; obsidian; onyx; pearls, zircon) each $:4d4

CITADEL OF THE BLOODY HAND
The first room is a small entry way about 20sq ft. There is a heavy barred iron door with a small bell attached to the side. If the party rings the bell, a latch will slide open on the door and a small voice will ask them “Whooo is it?” The voice will tell them to leave “or else” and then the opening slams shut. Some gears and machinery can be heard rumbling deep within the dungeon. DC 18 to know it came from the left.
When they get the door down and enter the next room, they will see an empty, square room. This room will have two narrow slits on the right side of the room, and when the party enters two arrows will be fired, with laughing and mockery behind them. There is a door on the left that is made of iron and barred from the other side. It cannot be opened except by a DC25 str check. There is a loose stone on the wall next to the entry door (left when walking in) that can be depressed to reveal a secret entrance to the control room. 
When they get the door down and enter the next room, it will be the exact same shape and size, with another identical door. There are arrow slits but nothing is fired when approached, but there is laughter. There is writing carved into the wall in goblin that says “HERE!!!” next to a torch holder with an arrow pointing towards it. The torch holder can be turned and a loud mechanical sound can be heard, but nothing happens. There are four statues of gargoyles around the room. They do not respond and are inanimate.
When they get the door down and enter the next room, it will be the exact same shape and size, with another identical door. In the center of the roof is a small grated hole. If someone walks underneath it, a vial of acid will drop on their head. Dex save to see if it hits. If it does, take 1d6+1 damage and roll again to see if any gear is destroyed. If second check fails, roll AGAIN to see what gets destroyed. There are four statues of gargoyles around the room. They will pretend to be inanimate, but two will attack when they can get a surprise.
When they get the door down and enter the next room, it will be the exact same shape and size, with another identical door. This room has the statues, hole in the roof, and arrow slits on both sides. All [[Traps\|Traps]] will activate this time. The statues will come alive, arrows will fire, acid will be dropped. On the left side of the room is a lit torch, the first source of light in the citadel. DC 12 search check will reveal it is a secret switch. 


Door man for crookspar parlor hassles party, black viper (70) gives them all of the information about xanathar, and gives an extra 100g each for finding the hidden entrance to COTBH. (65) (21)

Upstairs is Avaereene (65) a sorcerer who knows of the secret portal to the lair of the eye via the sewer. The map is in her possession. If the party kills her or passes a DC15 check on someone in the parlor they know of the secret entrance to the lair via the sewers, otherwise, the party must pass a persuasion check to convince a smuggler to give them a ride on a ship. They can find out the location of the lair by asking around but will get attacked
On agent’s body is a letter explaining how to open secret door in the sewers:
SF49, left at the T.
You’ll know how to open the door, just use the keyhole

Over the past few days the party has been relaxing in waterdeep, mingling with the locals and hearing rumors of treasure and glory. All party members make a skill check (history, arcana, investigation, religion, deception or intimidation) and add all of the results together.
Umberlee’s Cache- Start: (109) Deepwater Harbor, Tharqualnaar city, home of merfolk, Mermayor [[Root/Worlds/Other worlds/NPCs/Leomaris\|Leomaris]]. Mission: (120) Find the Deepwater Beacon, at the edge of the Umberlee’s Cache, and enter the depths in search of the treasure dropped into the sea by sailors.
For as long as anyone can remember, sailors have dropped gold coins from their ships when passing over the Deepwater Beacon into a huge hole at the bottom of the harbor to appease the ancient mermaid queen named Umberlee, the Bitch Queen. She has not been seen in hundreds of years, but it is rumored the friendly merfolk tribe known to live in the harbor watches over the huge cache of gold and may know more of the endless riches and the dark depths that contain them. 
Belkram’s Fall
Start: [[Root/Worlds/Faerun/NPCs/Gyudd Melairkyn\|Gyudd Melairkyn]] (113), heir to king [[Root/Worlds/Faerun/NPCs/Melair\|Melair]] Mission: Journey into Belkram’s Fall in search of the crown from Gyudd’s dreams. 
Gyudd, owner of Gyudd's Distillery in Skullport and heir to the royal Melairkyn bloodline, has been tormented by strange dreams of late. In them, he is being called to find the legacy of his family within Belkram's Fall. He has decided to sell his business and use the money to recruit able adventurers who are willing to assist him in discovering the source of his strange dreams. In his dreams, he sees a plain black crown bearing a single, blood-red gem. He always wakes from this dream with a blazing headache. Known as “The Shaft by non-dwarfs, Belkram’s fall extends 
The Storeroom Level
Start: The portal located deep in the dungeon level (88)
You’ve spoken with a few people very familiar with the undermountain about the mysterious portal you found deep in the dungeon level. One man had been through it before, and told of a leveled called “the Storeroom”, a large winding complex inhabited by a friendly camp of merchants and a mysterious alliance of dwarves and [[Drow\|Drow]] clearing the rubble for an unknown purpose. The storeroom is much less frequently and thoroughly explored than the dungeon level, and thus much riper with potential loot, and the odd alliance of dwarves and [[Drow\|Drow]]  is most likely more than initially meets the eye.

[[Root/Worlds/Faerun/Locations/Kryptgarden Forest\|Kryptgarden Forest]]: Unsubstantiated rumors of another dwarven citadel in the hills near the center of the forest have circulated in recent years. A mad adventurer, apparently the lone survivor of a nine-man adventuring company, was captured on Khedell Path in the plains west of [[Root/Worlds/Faerun/Locations/Red Larch\|Red Larch]]. He babbled about a citadel of erect standing insects casting spells and hurling weapons that killed a man from 500 paces. According to the mans crazed tales, the insects are able to camouflage themselves (probably magically) to the point where the only way to find the creatures is by scent and tracking. Hes a known liar, yet he was found with nothing in his possession and strange burns along his arms and back that cannot be explained.
[[Root/Worlds/Faerun/Locations/Ardeep Forest\|Ardeep Forest]]: The forest is forlorn and largely empty. The elves have left the forest of tall blueleaf, duskwood, and weirwood trees unattended. This region was known as Faraway Forest to the elves because, although it was near the coast of Faerûn, it was still far away from what the elves considered home ([[Root/Worlds/Faerun/Locations/Silverymoon\|Silverymoon]]). It is rumored that somewhere deep in this forest is the overgrown tomb of Reluraun, a warrior-hero of the elves, who lies in a vault clad in [[Campaign Resources/Equipment/Armour/Elven Chain\|Campaign Resources/Equipment/Armour/Elven Chain]] mail, with his famous [[Campaign Resources/Equipment/Weapons/Magic Weapons/Dragon Slayer\|Campaign Resources/Equipment/Weapons/Magic Weapons/Dragon Slayer]] sword on his breast. According to legend, the tomb is not unattended; magical creatures guard Reluraun’s remains. 
Goldfields: It is currently a fortified farm complex sprawling across 20 square miles. Within its walls, over 5,000 devout worshippers of Chauntea tend crops of grain and vegetables. (Chauntea (pronounced Chawn-TEE-ah) the Grain Goddess or the Great Mother was the goddess of life and a parallel deity to Silvanus, who was considered the god of wild nature, whilst Chauntea herself was seen as being the embodiment of all things agrarian or agriculture. She was a goddess of agriculture, plants cultivated by humans, farmers, gardeners, and summer.) 
The Stump Bog: This vast, sprawling bog is named for the numerous rotting stumps that rise from the still, green waters like blackened teeth; the dead trees were cut by an enterprising woodcutter long ago. Frog-fishermen are the only humans who have entered in the years since. The bogs algae-covered, muddy waters drain into this marsh from the River Dessarin just south of [[Root/Worlds/Faerun/Locations/Goldenfields\|Goldenfields]] and are home to many unpleasant creatures. The waters of the Stump Bog may hide many small treasures. Countless corpses have been dumped in the Bog over the years of fighting in the North; many wounded victims met death in the bog by getting lost, falling into the sticky morass, and drowning. Today, the bog remains a favorite corpse disposal site for brigands, thieves, and those who find it more convenient for someone to disappear than to be found dead more corpses of political enemies of Waterdhavian nobles can be found here than any other specific group of people. There are many rumors of sunken treasure in its murky waters, but those who plunge into them would do well to remember that danger is never very far away. The bog is rife with will owisps, mudmen, and various undead creatures after dark, though they dont stray from the bog. They havent been discovered due to the bogs size and one simple fact: No one goes there after dark.
[[Root/Worlds/Faerun/Locations/Rassalantar\|Rassalantar]]: The small community consisted of six walled farms. They centered around a spring-fed pond which drained into a stream and emptied to the east into the Stump Bog, a sprawling, desolate marsh haunted by monsters.[5] To the west of the farmhouses, a narrow patch of trees known as Keep Woods masked the ruins of [[Root/Worlds/Faerun/Locations/Rassalantar\|Rassalantar]]'s Keep, and to the east of the pond was the Sleeping Dragon.[6]

## LOCALES: THE WARDS OF WATERDEEP

Waterdeep has long been divided into several large regions called wards. To locals these are essential to Waterdeep, but outsiders often lose track of which ward they’re in or what a ward’s name signifies. 

Castle Ward. As the name indicates, Castle Ward contains Castle Waterdeep, Piergeiron’s Palace, and many other public buildings of the city. This ward is home to mainly the wealthy or influential who can’t count themselves among the nobility. Other structures are taken up by educational or religious concerns that primarily serve the city at large, not the residents of the ward.

Dock Ward. Most of the city’s harbor area is located in Dock Ward, as are the businesses and warehouses that depend on the city’s newly restored harbor. It’s a crowded neighborhood of many winding streets, where folk are comfortable making deals that might in other places provoke the displeasure of the law.

Field Ward. Of relatively recent vintage, the Field Ward stands between the inner and outer north walls of the city (an area formerly used as a caravan grounds). This ward grew up in a messy, unregulated fashion and is home to many of the poorest residents of the city.

North Ward. Home to many noble villas, townhouses, and a great many inns, North Ward is the neighborhood of the respectably wealthy.

Sea Ward. Those whose fortunes are on the rise build their homes in Sea Ward, and they join many long-established noble families in residence. This area in the northwest of the city is home to much of the city’s wealth, the location of the grandest villas of the city’s noble families (except for those in North Ward).

Southern Ward. Stables, warehouses, and shops related to overland trade dominate Southern Ward. Most residents are hardworking folk that load and unload caravan carts, and otherwise perform low-paying work.

Trades Ward. A narrow slice of land between the Castle Ward and the City of the Dead, Trades Ward is the center of commerce for the city, with most of the smaller transactions and respectable trade taking place here.

City of the Dead. The city’s walled cemetery, the City of the Dead is the only place in Waterdeep where it is legal to bury the deceased. It is used by many citizens as a public park during the day, a lovely green space of pretty mausoleums and grand statues in which to escape the city’s hustle and bustle.

Undercliff. While not considered by many to be a ward of the city, the little villages and many farms that sprawl across the land east of the city were lawfully incorporated into Waterdeep when it moved a barracks and training facility to the area.

## GUILDS: MEMBERSHIP

Any characters with the guild artisan background are assumed to have free membership in one Waterdeep guild.

To join a guild, one must possess a background, proficiency, or a status that the guild values. For example, a character with the sailor background is welcome to join the Master Mariners’ Guild.

Guilds charge members monthly or yearly dues that vary. For simplicity, you can have a guild charge 1 gp per month or 10 gp for a year’s dues paid in advance. A guild can expel a member for any number of reasons, not the least of which is failing to pay dues.

## FACTIONS: BREGAN D’AERTHE

A character must be a drow, preferably a male, to join this faction.

Bregan D’aerthe is a company of mercenaries originally made up of the much-derided and dishonorable castaways of destroyed drow houses. The group’s leader, [[Root/Worlds/Faerun/NPCs/Jarlaxle Baenre\|Jarlaxle Baenre]], is always looking for new members to fill the ranks, and loyalty is what matters to him most.

Almost all Bregan D’aerthe members are male because female drow rarely condescend to take orders from a male. A female drow can earn a place in the faction by decrying the drow matriarchy and convincing Jarlaxle that she would be an asset to the brotherhood. Jarlaxle employs non-drow operatives as well, none of whom know they’re working for him; such individuals aren’t considered members of the faction.

  

Bregan D’aerthe support comes in these ways:

- The adventurers receive small, unmarked black pouches of coins from an anonymous source.
    
- The adventurers receive an invitation to dine with Zardoz Zord aboard his flagship, during which Jarlaxle takes their measure and offers assistance if they impress him.
    
- Bregan D’aerthe members buy off or quietly dispose of individuals who threaten the adventurers (usually without asking).
    

## FACTIONS: EMERALD ENCLAVE

A character must demonstrate an interest in protecting nature or the natural order to join the Emerald Enclave. Druids and rangers are especially welcome.

Waterdeep harbors a few members of the faction, which seeks to foster harmony between nature and civilization. Members living in Waterdeep help guard the city against unnatural threats, including aberrations and undead. They also watch over the City of the Dead (Waterdeep’s public cemetery) and the city’s parks.

Members of the Emerald Enclave can be found in Phaulkonmere, a noble villa in the Southern Ward, and at the Snobeedle Orchard and Meadery in Undercliff.

  

Emerald Enclave support comes in these ways:

- Enclave members share information they’ve gathered from magical conversations with animals in the city.
    
- Melannor Fellbranch provides free food and care for the adventurers’ animals at Phaulkonmere.
    
- One adventurer receives a supernatural charm (see “Supernatural Gifts” in chapter 7 of the Dungeon Master’s Guide) bestowed by Jeryth Phaulkon.
    

  

## FACTIONS: FORCE GREY

To join Force Grey, one must first become a member of the Gray Hands. 

An individual who has served in the City Watch or the City Guard is eligible to join, as are characters who are willing to swear oaths to defend Waterdeep, its citizens, and its laws with their lives. Adventurers who show promise might be invited to join the Gray Hands.

Force Grey is an elite cadre of specialized adventurers, drawn from the ranks of the Gray Hands, whose fighting prowess is matched only by their loyalty to the city. Force Grey attracts the best of the best. Characters don’t begin their adventuring careers as members of Force Grey, but they can work up to that status.

  

Force Grey support comes in these ways:

- Adventurers who are arrested are released under the loose supervision of Vajra Safahr.
    
- The adventurers receive a helpful uncommon or rare magic item that they’re allowed to use for a time (until it mysteriously disappears).
    
- Meloon Wardragon or some other respected member of Force Grey helps the adventurers out of a tough situation.
    

## FACTIONS: HARPERS

A smart, non-evil character can join the Harpers of Waterdeep. Bards and wizards are especially welcome.

Harpers are altruists who work behind the scenes to keep power out of the hands of evil. They suspect that the Zhentarim is wholly or partially responsible for the escalation of violence in Waterdeep. Harper spies might utilize the adventurers to get at the truth. Various nobles and guildmasters are Harper sympathizers.

The Harpers have several secret gathering places in Waterdeep, among them Ulbrinter Villa, an estate located on Delzorin Street between Vhezoar Street and Brondar’s Way, in the North Ward (just south of Trollskull Alley). Harpers prefer to conduct their business in bustling inns or in quiet locations.

  

Harper support comes in these ways:

- The Harpers make common and uncommon potions and scrolls available to the adventurers at a reduced or deferred cost depending on the circumstances.
    
- [[Root/Worlds/Faerun/NPCs/Remallia Haventree\|Remallia Haventree]] feeds useful bits of information to the adventurers and might also offer them temporary shelter.
    
- If the adventurers are accosted and overwhelmed, one or more Harpers come to their rescue. A Harper rescue team usually consists of a bard or a mage, plus 1d4 + 3 spies or veterans.
    

## FACTIONS: LORD’S ALLIANCE

To become a member of the Lords’ Alliance faction in Waterdeep, a character must be a Waterdavian citizen. Those with criminal records can also join, provided they demonstrate their allegiance to the city.

The Lords’ Alliance is a confederation of cities and towns up and down the Sword Coast and throughout the  North, including (among others) Baldur’s Gate, Mirabar, Mithral Hall, Neverwinter, and Silverymoon. Members of the alliance must come to one another’s aid in times of need, and the organization uses field operatives (diplomats, spies, and assassins) to safeguard its interests.

Waterdeep is one of the most influential and invested members of the Lords’ Alliance. Waterdeep’s Open Lord, Laeral Silverhand, uses spies to keep tabs on adventurers in the city, rewarding those who place Waterdeep’s interests above their own.

  

Lords’ Alliance support comes in these ways:

- City Watch officials are notified that the characters are on “official business” for the Lords’ Alliance and instructed to provide support whenever they can.
    
- Mirt, a Masked Lord who serves as Laeral Silverhand’s advisor, invites the adventurers to dinner at his dilapidated mansion as a pretense for sharing rumors and imparting pearls of wisdom.
    
- The characters are granted a brief audience with Laeral Silverhand.
    

## FACTIONS: ORDER OF THE GAUNTLET

Any non-evil character can join the Order of the Gauntlet in Waterdeep. Clerics, monks, and paladins are especially welcome, particularly if they worship Helm, Torm, or Tyr.

The order’s mission is to seek out and destroy evil before it gains a foothold. The surge of violence in Waterdeep spurs members of the order to find adventurers who can help return peace to the city.

An individual can be a member of the faction and also a member of the clergy or a knight pledged to a specific god or temple. Members of the order act alone or in small groups. Some are Waterdavian natives; others hail from distant settlements and have come to the city on temple business.

  

Order of the Gauntlet support comes in these ways:

- If the adventurers require healing or other magic, a member of the order can facilitate meetings with local priests who worship non-evil deities.
    
- If the adventurers get in trouble with the law, a member of the order puts in a good word for them and tends to their affairs while they’re incarcerated.
    
- Hlam might show up and help the characters in an impending battle.
    

## FACTIONS: XANATHAR GUILD

Anyone can join the Xanathar Guild, which, despite its name, doesn’t have official guild status in Waterdeep. Before membership is granted, however, an applicant must pass a test that always involves the perpetration of a serious crime. Possibilities include murdering a guild member who has failed Xanathar in some fashion, kidnapping a Waterdavian citizen, collecting a ransom, robbing a hire-coach, or looting a warehouse.

Among low-ranking guild members, rampant speculation goes on about the true nature of Xanathar. Few have any inkling that their boss is a beholder, and fewer still have seen or spoken to the eye tyrant.

  

Xanathar Guild support comes in these ways:

- Any member given an assignment might receive a monstrous bodyguard or assistant , who has secret instructions to kill the guild member if they fail to complete the assignment as ordered.
    
- The guild grants access to secret tunnels and safe houses (hidden cellars) underneath Waterdeep.
    
- Xanathar might send a gazer to help (and spy on) an up-and-coming guild member.
    

## FACTIONS: ZHENTARIM

The Black Network has an open recruitment policy. Anyone can join. Tenacity and loyalty are highly valued (but not essential) traits in new members.

The [[Root/Worlds/Faerun/Factions/Zhentarim\|Zhentarim]] is a shadow organization that trades mercenaries and goods (including weapons) for profit. It has long sought to gain political influence in Waterdeep, but the strength of the city’s Masked Lords, nobility, and professional guilds makes that difficult.

The [[Root/Worlds/Faerun/Factions/Zhentarim\|Zhentarim]] in [[Root/Worlds/Barovia/Locations/Waterdeep\|Waterdeep]] is a fractured organization. Those who support [[Root/Worlds/Faerun/NPCs/Manshoon\|Manshoon]] want to destroy [[Xanathar\|Xanathar]] and seize political and economic control of the city. Those who oppose Manshoon want to expose and destroy him before they are themselves apprehended or driven out of the city by the local authorities.

  

[[Root/Worlds/Faerun/Factions/Zhentarim\|Zhentarim]] support comes in these ways:

- Davil can arrange meetings with influential nobles and members of city guilds.
    
- Adventurers can procure discounted potions and poisons from Skeemo’s shop, Weirdbottle’s Concoctions, in the Trades Ward.
    
- Tashlyn offers mercenaries, either thugs costing 2 sp per day each or veterans costing 2 gp per day each.
    
- Istrid offers loans of up to 2,500 gp with an interest rate of 10 percent per tenday.
    
- Adventurers can hire Ziraj to assassinate someone, in return for some undisclosed favor to be called in later.
    

## SPEECH: SPEAK LIKE A NATIVE

“Dabbler but no master” and “No mastery blazing forth” These idioms trace their origin to Ahghairon, who early on in his studies of magic humbly said, “I am no wizard. I am a dabbler but no master of magic; it seems no mastery burns within me.” Both now serve as expressions of false modesty applied to any skill or craft, not just magic use.

“Toughs,” “sharpjaws,” “fastfists,” “bullyblades,” and “alleyblades” “Toughs” is a general collective term for habitual street loiterers. Those who boast of martial skill but who shrink from violence or lack real ability are “sharpjaws.” In sharp contrast are Waterdeep’s “fastfists” (any lout easily provoked to violence), “bullyblades” (battle-hardened mercenaries hired as muscle), and “alleyblades” (muggers and thieves).

“Longride” and “Last ride” To a caravan merchant, a drover, or a farmer from the lands around Waterdeep, as well as any Waterdavian who rides for sport, recreation, hunting, or falconry, the late afternoon is “longride,” and dusk is “last ride.”

“Which the greater thief?” Tuezaera Hallowhand was a famous “lone cat” thief of Waterdeep in the 1200s DR, who disappeared suddenly and is thought to have come to a violent end. She once robbed a wizard and wrote this on his wall with a fingertip dipped in his favorite red wine: “I take things. You take freedom with your spells. Which of us is the greater thief?” Waterdavians now use this phrase in argument with one another over all kinds of matters when comparing wrongs done.

“Doth thy mirror crack?” or “Hurl but think not?” or “Take but not count cost? Be nothing, then!” [[Root/Worlds/Faerun/NPCs/Laeral Silverhand\|Laeral Silverhand]], then the Lady Mage of Waterdeep when she was married to [[Root/Worlds/Faerun/NPCs/Khelben “Blackstaff” Arunsun\|Khelben “Blackstaff” Arunsun]], once publicly rebuked an overambitious wizard of the Watchful Order of Magists and Protectors thusly: “If I hurl spells but think not of consequences, I am nothing. If I take lives but count not the cost, I am nothing. If I steal in the night and see not the faces of the devastated come the next morning, I am nothing. If I make decrees like a ruler but undertake none of the other responsibilities of the throne, I am nothing. And if I do all these things in the name of the Watchful Order, I am less than nothing. Doth thy mirror crack?”

“Fang gangs” Dock Ward and South Ward street gangs who use knives and carve gang “sigils” on their forearms (or less conspicuous places) and on their victims.

“Rose” the Waterdhavian term for a beau, a suitor, or “the one I desire.” “He’s my rose” or “She’s my rose” can mean either “He or she is the one I want” or “We long for each other.”

“Blackstaff” is the title given to the master of eponymous staff and tower and the Archmage of Waterdeep. “Blackstaff” and “High Wizard” can be used interchangeably, but “Archmage” is slightly less official.

## SPEECH: HOW TO ADDRESS RULERS

In Waterdeep, most citizens rarely have the opportunity to speak to the Masked Lords (the anonymous rulers of Waterdeep, who may or may not be noble) directly, aside from very formal settings such as legal trials. When they do, they’re usually speaking to a row of featureless masks, so they say merely, “Lords.” When speaking to the Open Lord, almost every Waterdhavian who isn’t his personal friend will say “Lord Silverhand,” shortening it to “Lord” only if they converse together for a time.

## SPEECH: WATCH TALK

Members of the City Watch employ a sort of slang in dealing with the public. As a visitor, it behooves you to know what they mean.

“What befalls?” means “Someone tell me what’s going on here.”

“Hold!” means “Don’t move a muscle.”

“Down arms!” means “Drop your weapons.”

“Talk truth!” means “Answer me” or “Tell the whole story.”

“Robes” references the black robes — in other words, one of the magisters. “Do we need robes here?” or something similar should be taken as a threat.

“Goodsir” and “goodwife” are the terms members of the Watch use to address adult citizens.

“Jack” and “goodlass”  are the terms members of the Watch use to address younger citizens.

“Gentlesir” and “goodlady” are the terms members of the Watch use to address Waterdhavian nobility or diplomatic guests. Mixed-gender noble groups are addressed as “gentles.”

“Sir” or “sorn sir” is the all-purpose formal form of address when members of the Watch speak to superiors.

## SPEECH: “NOBLESPEAK” IN WATERDEEP

 A Waterdhavian addresses everyone of known noble status as “lord” or “lady” (toddlers and young children usually as “young lord” or “young lady”). Brief bows are considered polite, but deep or florid ones are now often taken as mockery. 

“Saer” (rather than “sir”), or “goodwoman” for a female, is used by those uncertain of a person’s status but not wanting to give offense. No offense will be taken (except when one Waterdhavian noble addresses another one as “saer”). 

“Bladderblat” and “Glunder” are not real Waterdhavian [[Noble\|Noble]] surnames, but every city inhabitant or frequent visitor knows them. They are the two fictitious [[Noble\|Noble]] surnames most popular among Waterdhavian satirical broadsheet writers, minstrels, and tellers of rude street jokes. (“How did Lord Bladderblat decide if young Lady Glunder was a suitable match for his son? He tried her out himself, of course. Several times.”) 

To address a Bladderblat as “young master” or “young mistress” is seen as a form of admonishment. (The word “miss” in the Realms means “fail to hit what you were aiming at”; it’s unknown as a form of address.) 

Among adult Waterdhavian nobles (who, naturally, all know each other and see each other often at feasts, clubs, and revels), it’s an insult to address someone by the wrong title. Nobles refer to themselves as “we lords” or “we worthies,” and they speak of the ruling Hidden Lords and the Open Lord as “the Lords of the City.” Nobles usually refer to non-[[Noble\|[[nob]]le]] Waterdhavians as “citizens” when being polite, and “commoners” when being impolite.

## NOBILITY: BECOMING [[Noble\|Noble]] IN [[Root/Worlds/Faerun/Locations/Waterdeep\|Waterdeep]]

To put it succinctly: Forget it. Nobility in Waterdeep is a closed shop.Old-money merchants once conferred [[Noble\|Noble]] status on themselves in return for their support of common laws and their descendants are working hard to prevent new-money merchants — or anyone else! — from gaining a title. No matter what angle you think you’re viewing them from, the nobles of [[Root/Worlds/Barovia/Locations/Waterdeep\|Waterdeep]] will be looking down upon you. It’s what they do.
