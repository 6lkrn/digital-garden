The [[Root/Worlds/Faerun/Locations/Triboar\|Triboar]] Trail starts at [[Root/Worlds/Faerun/Locations/Triboar\|Triboar]], heads west, goes around the north of the [[Root/Worlds/Faerun/Locations/Sword Mountains\|Sword Mountains]], cuts past [[Root/Worlds/Faerun/Locations/Phandalin\|Phandalin]], and ends in the High Road.

**Micro-Worldbuilding Opportunity:** There has got to be more than just a Mission House where the [[Root/Worlds/Faerun/Locations/Triboar\|Triboar]] Road meets the High Road, wouldn’t you say? I'm thinking that there would be a village there that will deal with the intersection.
