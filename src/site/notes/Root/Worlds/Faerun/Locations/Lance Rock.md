(Source: *Princes of the Apocalypse*, pages 151-153)

Back in my first run of *Princes of the Apocalypse*, I set up a necromancer that was putting fancy costumes on zombies. I later got the idea of said Necromancer recreating the audio-animatronics in the ‘Five Nights at Freddy’s’ series. I'll be remaking that scene when I redo this dungeon.
