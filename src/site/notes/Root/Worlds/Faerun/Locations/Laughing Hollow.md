You’ve probably heard of the phrase, ‘A stretch of bad road,’ so this can be best described as ‘a stretch of bad river,’ not by the flora creating all of this shade, but of the eerie feeling that they're being watched by malevolent eyes. Especially if the traveler is not a full-blooded [[Elf\|elf]].

If you don’t have to go through this part of the river, you don’t go, preferring instead to go around on road to [[Root/Worlds/Faerun/Locations/Julkoun\|Julkoun]] or another city up river.

The Laughing Hollow will have a place in “The Fall of Illefarn,” (Part of *Ghosts of Dragonspear* Castle) if applicable. Otherwise, have it be an eerie place that no non-[[Elf\|elf]] would dare to go. Perfect for [[Eldreth Veluuthra\|Eldreth Veluuthra]] shenanigans. If the party manages to deal with the [[Eldreth Veluuthra\|Eldreth Veluuthra]] group in this region, [[Root/Worlds/Faerun/NPCs/Duke Floshin\|Duke Floshin]] will take over the region and make it a bit more non-[[Elf\|elf]] friendly.

Another item to fill in here, which I’ll probably be using in my recreation of *Scourge of the Sword Coast* is shown in *Ghosts of Dragonspear Castle*. It’ll be with a rework of an 1st Edition campaign, *Under Illifran*, which I’ll use to link *Scourge of the Sword Coast* to the updated *Dead in Thay* dungeon available in *Tales of the Yawning Portal*.
