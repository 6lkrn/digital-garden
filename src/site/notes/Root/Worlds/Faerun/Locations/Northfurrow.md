**Micro-Worldbuilding Opportunities:** I already added [[Root/Worlds/Faerun/Locations/Frickley\|Frickley]] into this region, but there's always more room for such farming villages going up and down the area. Too bad I might need to zoom into a Hex Grid to place any more of them. Good thing I supported HexKit.
