**Micro-Worldbuilding Opportunities:** The High Forest itself is large enough to have their own complete campaign and people who go too far inside the forest will find themselves in a Natural Made Demiplane. My Thursday table were only able to brave their own path across because, in the middle of the venture, they gave some dead druids a respectful burial.

Woodland spirits might be overprotective, but they know props when they see it.
