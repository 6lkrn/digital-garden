The official Delimbiyr Road, aka the Shining Trail, stretches from [[Root/Worlds/Faerun/Locations/Julkoun\|Julkoun]], through [[Root/Worlds/Faerun/Locations/Secomber\|Secomber]], and on to [[Root/Worlds/Faerun/Locations/Loudwater\|Loudwater]], where it becomes the [[Root/Worlds/Faerun/Locations/Grayvale\|Grayvale]] Run.

Traveling merchants had a need for a path going east of the [[Root/Worlds/Faerun/Locations/High Forest\|High Forest]] so that they don't have to go the long away around the West part of the [[Root/Worlds/Faerun/Locations/High Forest\|High Forest]]. Because of this, the [[Root/Worlds/Faerun/Factions/Order of the Gauntlet\|Order of the Gauntlet]] and the [[Root/Worlds/Faerun/Factions/Emerald Enclave\|Emerald Enclave]] pooled their resources to create a new road, extending the Delimbiyr Road; starting at [[Root/Worlds/Faerun/Locations/Jalanthar\|Jalanthar]], going down the Delimbiyr River and connecting with the original Delimbiyr Road at [[Root/Worlds/Faerun/Locations/Loudwater\|Loudwater]].

Construction is not expected to run smoothly, from the local monsters, barbarians, and orcs that are in the way, to the Elven and Woodland creatures fearing what the outsiders would use this road for, to the [[Root/Worlds/Other worlds/NPCs/Eldreth Valuuthra\|Eldreth Valuuthra]] considering such a road a threat to their existence. Expect whole campaigns to be devoted in the creation of this much-needed route.
