If nobody has dealt with Arik “The [[Root/Worlds/Faerun/Locations/Wormford\|Wormford]] Bat” Stillmarsh, then you can keep this place as written in the book. You can even include a side quest by Fred Love (link: <https://www.dmsguild.com/product/203870>) to deal with him.

If the vampire is taken care of, the Inn will be on some disarray as the Innkeeper, [[Root/Worlds/Faerun/NPCs/Nalaskur Thaelond\|Nalaskur Thaelond]], deals with the loss of his top client. If this happened in a previous campaign, Nalaskur will ask the party to find out who killed Arik without letting them know that he’s a vampire. If the party was the one who killed [[Root/Worlds/Faerun/NPCs/Arik Stillmarsh\|Arik Stillmarsh]] and Nalaskur catches wise that they did so, he will send the fury of the whole [[Black Network\|Black Network]] on them. The [Zhentarim](Zhentarim.md) would even contact any members in the party and order a Yakuza style hit on the individuals.

This might be awkward if you use [[Factions\|factions]] in your campaign.
