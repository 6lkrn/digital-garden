This is near [[Root/Worlds/Faerun/NPCs/Iymrith\|Iymrith]]’s Lair, which is where the final battle of *Storm King’s Thunder* takes place. After that module, [[Root/Worlds/Faerun/NPCs/Iymrith\|Iymrith]] and possibly her two offspring will no doubt be killed by the party. But there can be another use for this location.

**Micro-Worldbuilding Opportunities**: The magic that would allow the stone ships to float on water, and possibly create boats the float on air, may still be buried in a tomb near the place. Maybe kept hidden in [[Root/Worlds/Faerun/NPCs/Iymrith\|Iymrith]]’s lair, right under her eyes. A dwarven party might want to find this.
