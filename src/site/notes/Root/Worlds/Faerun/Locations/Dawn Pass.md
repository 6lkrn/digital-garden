Whatever or not you want the [[Root/Worlds/Faerun/Factions/Zhentarim\|Zhentarim]]s to be dicks here is up to the DMâ€¦and whatever or not the party has pissed off the [[Root/Worlds/Faerun/Factions/Zhentarim\|Zhentarim]]s anytime. (Did they kill that Vampire?)

I'd probably just put in a Mission House here. Maybe a bigger Mission House that has the gate.
