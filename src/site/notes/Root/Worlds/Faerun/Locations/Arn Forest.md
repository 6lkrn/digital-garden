**Micro-Worldbuilding Opportunities**: Situated due south of the [Adbar Citadel](Adbar%20Citadel.md) region and west of [Ascore](Ascore.md) (within reach of the High Ice Glacier in [[Root/Worlds/Faerun/Locations/Anauroch\|Anauroch]],) these unassuming woods can be more than they appear to be. There is a rock [[Gnome\|gnome]] community that I can put in there once the need comes up.
