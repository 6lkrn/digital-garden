**Expansion Area**

Listed in this section are some areas where I intend to build and expand on in future issues. The first of which is Adbar Citadel (Yes, I switched the word order).

In *Storm King’s Thunder*, the Citadel’s king, [[Adbar\|Adbar]] was killed in a prior attack with barbarians, and a shadow government hired a doppelganger to take [[Adbar\|Adbar]]’s place, without the general populace’s knowledge. If this doppelganger is exposed, like say being killed in an encounter with [[Yakfolk\|Yakfolk]], it would bring the whole place into chaos. Things will get nasty until a replacement king is set up, or a representative from the neighbouring [Felbarr Citadel](Felbarr%20Citadel.md) tries to take over the place, which will no doubt result in war.

Wouldn’t it be a bit convenient for a Frost Giant Jarl to be behind it all?

I have already added [Stagwick](Stagwick.md) to the map. The Adbar Citadel expansion will cover the immediate region with [[Hartwick Castle\|Hartwick Castle]], the [[Cold Woods\|Cold Woods]], and all the other locations listed in the Adventurer’s League modules:

-   DDAL05-04 In Dire Need

-   DDAL05-05 A Dish Best Served Cold

-   DDAL05-11 Forgotten Traditions

-   DDAL05-13 Jarl Rising

-   DDAL05-17 Hartkiller's Horn

The Campaign will incorporate all of these modules into a single storyline.
