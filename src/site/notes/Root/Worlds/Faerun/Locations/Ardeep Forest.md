**Map**: [Ardeep Forest Hex Grid](onenote:General.one#Ardeep Forest&section-id={E0DE68E7-0DCB-40CD-8344-BF02D93D6DBF}&page-id={776A499E-752B-4F4B-995F-0E6A54284723}&end&base-path=https://d.docs.live.net/e21b9e20e83c1882/Documents/Foxfire Forgotten Realms)

Ardeep Forest was invoked only slightly in *Storm King’s Thunder*, but the woodland takes centre stage in *Scourge of the Sword Coast*, where three of the five available chapters occupy either in or around the area.

The elves here are very wary of all outsiders, as hinted at by the end of the [[Root/Worlds/Faerun/Locations/Nightstone\|Nightstone]] chapter of *Storm King’s Thunder*. They will be more present in *Scourge of the Sword Coast*, where the [Eldreth Valuuthra](Eldreth%20Valuuthra.md) and [[Root/Worlds/Faerun/NPCs/Duke Floshin\|Duke Floshin]] battle in a war of ideals over the hearts of the Wild Elves. The former wants to envelop the Ardeep Elves into their fold, while Floshin wishes to open talks between them and the humans around them to forge a peace treaty. Floshin will be busy with establishing these relations when my revised *Scourge of the Sword Coast* begins.

I’ll be using a lot of earlier sources to do the needed fleshing out of the Ardeep, starting with none other than [Volothamp Geddarm](Volothamp%20Geddarm.md)’s account of the region from Dragon Magazine. [Elminister Aumar](Elminister%20Aumar.md) might call his research questionable at best (which haven’t changed much if Volo’s Guide to Monsters is any indication,) but for a Micro-worldbuilding purpose, I find that Spoony Bard indispensable.
Oh, and when I call him a Spoony Bard, it’s a mark of endearment. Stay you, Volo!

By the Gods, how old *is* this spoony bard?

Elminister: That’s something that shocks even *me*, David of the Foxfires.

Me: What are you doing in my computer, mister?!
