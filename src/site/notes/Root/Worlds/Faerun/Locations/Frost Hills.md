**Micro-Worldbuilding Opportunities**: I haven’t thought much about this region, mainly because of [[Root/Worlds/Faerun/Locations/Mithral Hall\|Mithral Hall]], but that place would have some smaller homesteads surround it no doubt, it would make for a good starting village for a campaign around the region.
