**Major City**: As segregated as it is (Humans above, Dwarves below; at least they talk to each other) Mirabar will be a good city for the party to rest up, restock supplies, upgrade equipment, and so on.

It is also home to one of the largest non-faction groups in the North: The [[Root/Worlds/Faerun/Factions/Mirabar Miner's Union\|Mirabar Miner's Union]]. They are the ones running the many mines there, as listed in the book above the city entry. The Union ensures their safety and well-being of the miners, and ensures that no funny business happens in the farm.

Of course, though, if they strike….

**[[Campaign Resources/Magic/Spells/Teleportation Circle\|Teleportation Circle]]:** The Circle is still hidden from the Mirabar authorities, and Zazspar Bronzefire makes sure it’s hidden. Or…

**Micro-Worldbuilding Opportunities**: …he might have moved it to a less controversial space, maybe a homestead or farm just outside of the city limits.
