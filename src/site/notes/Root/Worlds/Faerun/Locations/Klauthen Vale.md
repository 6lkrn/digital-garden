I just had a bunch of barbarians come up with a Cult of [[Root/_Ongoing Campaign/20. One Piece/Strahds Lieutenants/The Dragon Governer\|The Dragon Governer]] airship, but I have to tell you, I’m very fascinated with [[Root/Worlds/Faerun/NPCs/Klauth\|Klauth]]! I like to go by “No Two Dragons are Alike” and sometimes they can do things that just aren’t expected for Dragons to do. A Dragon who kidnapped a princess might actually be that princess’ chosen champion, and the party would find the dragon curled up reading to her when they get into his lair (who would then warn the party that the King is becoming too overcontrolling, and is in fact the big bad of the adventure.)

Such is the case with Old Snarl here, very vicious when it comes to other dragons, but actually nice to humans. I could see the Red Dragon—of all monsters—owing the party a favor and will come to their aid in return for an earlier good deed.

He’ll be right at home in Æthercoil.
