Q'Xorlarrin

This is a former [[Root/Worlds/Faerun/Locations/Underdark\|Underdark]] village that links [[Root/Worlds/Faerun/Locations/Gauntlgrym\|Gauntlgrym]]  with the [[Root/Worlds/Faerun/Locations/Underdark\|Underdark]] at large, originally built by Dwarves but abandoned and found by [[Root/Worlds/Faerun/Factions/House Xorlarrin\|House Xorlarrin]] (who renamed it in their image.) [[Root/Worlds/Faerun/Locations/Gauntlgrym\|Gauntlgrym]] wouldn’t even know of this village until someone went and steals the [[Dawn Titan\|Dawn Titan]] from under their collective noses. Small wonder why [[Bruneor Battlehammer\|Bruneor Battlehammer]] loses his church membership because of it. If I have any expansions to the [[Root/Worlds/Faerun/Locations/Underdark\|Underdark]], it’ll probably start here.
