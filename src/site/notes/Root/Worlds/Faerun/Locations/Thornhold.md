In the cannon depiction, it is rumored that there is a cave under this unadorned castle that leads into the [[Root/Worlds/Faerun/Locations/Underdark\|Underdark]], which is why the Dwarves that run this castle have restricted areas from any visitors. In my version, it's no rumor: The Dwarves there are protecting the surface region from a very real path to the [[Root/Worlds/Faerun/Locations/Underdark\|Underdark]]--where there is still a problem with demons ousted from the Abyss--which they also use as a mine and a workshop. They are still very cordial to the public and keep up a hospitable waystation for travelers along the High Road.

**Micro-Worldbuilding Opportunity:** That mine that leads down to the [[Root/Worlds/Faerun/Locations/Underdark\|Underdark]].
