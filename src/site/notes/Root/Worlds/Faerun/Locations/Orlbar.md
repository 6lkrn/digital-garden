**Micro-Worldbuilding Opportunities:** After they deal with any Stone Giant encounter (Three Stone Giants) to keep them from dismantling the tower, this would be an excellent place for any party to set up a homestead. In fact, one of my Encounter Tables have already started theirs in this location.

If you do choose this place to set up your own village, whatever you deal with Zorkh is up to you. Being that he’s deaf, only cares about playing building blocks with stone, lets goats follow him around and just keeps to himself in a nearby cave, I doubt he'll cause much problems. Hell, he might be interested in watching the humans from his vantage point in his cave.
