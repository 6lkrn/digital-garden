**Micro-Worldbuilding Opportunities**: With the construction of the [[Root/Worlds/Faerun/Locations/Delimbiyr Road\|Delimbiyr Road]] Extension, there’s going to be a lot of homesteads, Mission Houses, Villages, and the like along the route, which will also attract the monsters, insurgents, and hassles form the various forests, hills, and mountains surrounding the region. Because of this, I’m setting up the *Against the Giants* campaign here as the latter parts of a homebrew campaign based on the Vale. Development of this campaign will occur in later issues.
