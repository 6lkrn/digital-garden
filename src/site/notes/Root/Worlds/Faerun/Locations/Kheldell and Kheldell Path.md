(Source: *Storm King’s Thunder*, page 95; *The Sunless Citadel*)

When I read the first dungeon of *Tales of the Yawning Portal*, I just knew that I had to put it near a village that has those[[ Dusk Circle Druids\| Dusk Circle Druids]]. [[Root/Worlds/Faerun/NPCs/Fack Thundertree\|Fack Thundertree]] and Mount Hotenow; they have their own problems. *The Sunless Citadel* in [[Kheldell\|Kheldell]] was an opportunity I can’t pass up.

Because of this, I’m going to incorporate Oakhurst into [[Kheldell\|Kheldell]], with a regional hex grid will take the party to the dungeon proper. Its road to [[Root/Worlds/Faerun/Locations/Red Larch\|Red Larch]] isn't be changed from the cannon.
