(Source: *Storm King’s Thunder*, Page 79)

The Encounter listed here won’t be appropriate in a post *Storm King’s Thunder* Realms, but King Morinn and Queen Tithmel would have another problem that needs dealing with. This will lead to my compiled campaign in the [[Root/Worlds/Faerun/Locations/Adbar Citadel\|Adbar Citadel]] region:

They would have heard about what’s going on in [[Root/Worlds/Faerun/Locations/Adbar Citadel\|Adbar Citadel]], and think that things might not be as they seem. They heard about King Harnoth not acting like himself, and [[Fear\|fear]] that old age or battle fatigue is catching up with him. They will request the party to investigate the matter.

They can be easily placated with the [[Shield\|Shield]] Pendants Harnoth would give to them, but if the truth is revealed, the King and Queen would’ve expected something like this would happen, because they have seen the real Harnoth get killed, but with the stand-in, nobody believed them. The Dwarves in Felbarr would want to deal with Adbar, and possibly take it over and instill a king that they would trust. Cue a quest of Dwarven Political Intrigue that will be part of the Adbar campaign.
