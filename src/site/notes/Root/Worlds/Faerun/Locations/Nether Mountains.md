**Micro-Worldbuilding Opportunities**: Another mountain range to place a mine; another mountain range to place a dragon lair. It's all good.

I'll be placing *White Plume Mountain* in this area, around [[Root/Worlds/Faerun/Locations/Sundabar\|Sundabar]]. A [[Dwarf\|Dwarf]] there will slip away into the surface world and ask for a party of adventurers to quietly deal with the lost treasures (The Three Treasures from the *Dungeon Master’s Guide*) which he's researching. He fears the [[Root/Worlds/Other worlds/NPCs/Eldreth Valuuthra\|Eldreth Valuuthra]]  getting their hands on them—or worse, a [[Dwarf\|Dwarf]] getting them and starting a dwarven version of the [[Root/Worlds/Other worlds/NPCs/Eldreth Valuuthra\|Eldreth Valuuthra]]!
