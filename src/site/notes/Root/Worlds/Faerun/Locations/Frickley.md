(Source: *Giantslayer*)

Frickley is a town mentioned in M. T. Black's *Giantslayer* module (Link: <http://www.dmsguild.com/product/195471/> ), which I put into my Storm King Thunder campaign. I situated the village between [[Root/Worlds/Faerun/Locations/Waterdeep 1\|Waterdeep 1]] and [[Root/Worlds/Faerun/Locations/Goldenfields\|Goldenfields]] where it still lays today. The town's layout and denizens, including one Jahia Giantslayer who is living out the rest of her years in the village, remains as written in the module and will be reused later as my [[Root/Campaigns/Campaigns\|campaigns]] revisit the village.
