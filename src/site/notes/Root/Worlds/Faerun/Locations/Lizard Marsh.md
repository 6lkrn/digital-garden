(Sources: *Storm King’s Thunder*, Page 96; *Ghosts of Dragonspear Castle*)

Since I'm not putting Pancheska in the same place Wizards did in *Storm King’s Thunder*, I can put something else in here, *Fane of the Sun Swallower* from *Ghosts of Dragonspear Castle* is an excellent candidate to fill in the missing gap.
