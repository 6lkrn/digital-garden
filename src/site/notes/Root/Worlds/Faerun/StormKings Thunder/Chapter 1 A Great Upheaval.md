# **Synopsis:** 

This chapter is designed to advance a party of 1st-level characters to 5th level. The characters gain levels by accomplishing various goals, which are summarized in the Character Advancement sidebar at the end of the chapter. If the characters are already 5th level, skip ahead to chapter 2, "Rumblings," using the information in appendix A if the characters are transitioning from another published adventure to this one.
 
[Nightstone] is a fortified settlement located a few miles south of the **Ardeep Forest**, in the untamed hills between **Waterdeep** and **Daggerford**. A lonely wooden signpost, standing where the trail to Nightstone meets the High Road, points the way to the settlement.
 
Nightstone's closest neighbors are the elves of the Ardeep Forest. Hunters from Nightstone have incurred the elves' wrath on multiple occasions. However, elves are the least of the settlement's problems, as fledgling heroes who come to Nightstone in search of adventure quickly discover.

# **Story Hooks:**

The characters are traveling to Nightstone for one or more of the following reasons:
 

-   The characters have heard rumors of goblins terrorizing the settlement. The High Steward of Nightstone, Lady [Velrosa Nandar], is a Waterdhavian noble. She is reportedly offering a reward to anyone willing and able to deal with the goblin threat.

-   Nightstone is a popular retreat for wealthy nobles who wish to hunt in the Ardeep Forest. Adventurers can earn good money by offering their services as guards on a hunt.

-   The residents of Nightstone have a longstanding and seemingly irreconcilable conflict with their northern neighbors, the elves of the Ardeep Forest. Lady Velrosa Nandar has been searching for skilled mediators to help resolve the dispute.

-   The Nightstone Inn is renowned for its food and cozy guest rooms. The dwarf innkeeper, [Morak UrGray], has a fondness for adventurers and a nose for lucrative adventuring opportunities.

-   You can create other adventure hooks using the information presented in this chapter about Nightstone.
 
# **Character Advancement Milestones:** 

Characters gain levels in this chapter by completing the goals summarized below:
 
Characters who explore [[Root/Worlds/Faerun/Locations/Nightstone\|Nightstone]] and defeat the goblins in the village advance to **2nd level**.
Characters who deal with the Zhentarim operatives ([Seven Snakes]) and survive the [Ear Seekers] Orc siege (with or without the assistance of the elves of the Ardeep Forest) advance to **3rd level**.
Characters who survive the perils of the [Dripping Caves] advance to **4th level**, regardless of how many villagers they rescue.
Characters advance to **5th level** after their encounters with the air cultists and the Lords' Alliance strike team ([Unfriendly Skies]).
  
The characters should be 5th level by the time they reach **Bryn Shander**, **Goldenfields**, or **Triboar**, as described in Chapter 2.
