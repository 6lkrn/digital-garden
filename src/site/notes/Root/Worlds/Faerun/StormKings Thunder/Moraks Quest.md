Characters who survive the perils of the [Dripping Caves] and return to [Nightstone] should advance to 4th level.

Once he is safely back in the village, [Morak UrGray] takes stock of the damage, makes arrangements to deliver news of the giants' attack to Waterdeep, and urges the characters to undertake one of the following three quests. If Morak died in the Dripping Caves, another NPC can give the quest in his place. Choose whichever quest you like. Your choice will determine whether the characters visit **Bryn Shander, Goldenfields**, or **Triboar** in the next leg of the adventure (see chapter 2). Whether or not the characters accept Morak's quest, continue with the "[Tower of Zephyros]" section.

# **Bryn Shander Quest**
Morak's friend and neighbor, Semile Southwell, was killed in the giant attack. Although she had no family in Nightstone, Semile spoke often about her brother, Markham. Morak knows that Markham is the sheriff of **Bryn Shander** and asks the characters to travel to Icewind Dale and deliver the sad news of Semile's passing.
Â 
# **Goldenfields Quest**
The Xelbrins were killed in their home when the giants bombarded the village (see "Nightstone," area 4h). Morak recalls that the elderly couple had a son, Miros, who lives in **Goldenfields**. Morak asks the characters to visit Goldenfields and let Miros know what has happened. If the Xelbrins' tressym is still alive, Morak asks the characters to deliver it safely to Miros.

# **Triboar Quest**
Morak's friend and neighbor, Darthag Ulgar, was eaten by giant rats. Darthag ran the Lionshield Coster trading post in Nightstone, and his ex-wife runs a similar trading post in **Triboar**. Morak asks the characters to travel to Tri boar and deliver the sad news of Darthag's passing to Alaestra Ulgar.
