An Introductory Adventure for Storm King's Thunder.

Characters of Level 1-5

*As evening approaches, you spot a wooden signpost next to a trail that heads north into the hills. Nailed to the post are three arrow-shaped signs. The two marked “Waterdeep” and “Daggerford” follow the High Road but point in opposite directions. The third, marked “Nightstone,” beckons you to follow the trail. If memory serves, Nightstone is roughly ten miles up the trail.*

This 21-page adventure is the first Chapter of the StormKing's Thunder Campaign. I included it in this format because WotC allows you to download the PDF of this adventure for free, and I wanted to show the slight difference in page hierarchy for this adventure. The land mass covered by this campaign is hundreds of times larger than Curse of Strahd and the book has a tendency to provide names for every character regardless of how minor they are, so this changes how I lay out the adventure. Here the locations are sorted by Chapter rather than alphabetically, and very few characters are given their own character page by default unless they are a **Dramatis Personae / Major NPC**. Later on I consider adding more character pages, if players bond with a minor character during play and that character takes on a larger role and becomes a reoccurring character for their game.
