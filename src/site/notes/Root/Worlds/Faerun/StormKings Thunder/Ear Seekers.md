The following special events can occur while the characters are in [[Root/Worlds/Faerun/Locations/Nightstone\|Nightstone]]. **Ideally, the characters are 2nd level before either event occurs.**
 

# **Event - Ear Seekers:**

The wood elves of the [[Root/Worlds/Faerun/Locations/Ardeep Forest\|Ardeep Forest]] are at war with a neighbouring tribe of orcs called the **Ear Seekers** (so named because they wear necklaces made of [[Elf\|Elf]] ears). Gurrash, the orc war chief, recently led an attack on the forest. Unfortunately for the orcs, the elves were ready for them. More than half of the orc horde perished, and the surviving orcs were forced to flee. Gurrash and several orcs escape out of the forest, make their way south, and stumble upon [[Root/Worlds/Faerun/Locations/Nightstone\|Nightstone]]. Knowing that the elves aren't far behind, Gurrash and his orcs try to fight their way into the village and make a stand there.
 
**Gurrash**, the orc war chief, is bleeding from wounds inflicted by elven arrows and has **60 hit points remaining**. He leads a force consisting of **twenty** uninjured [[orcs\|orcs]] and an uninjured [orc Eye of Gruumsh] named **Norgra One-Eye**. Norgra is Gurrash's lieutenant and assumes command if the war chief dies.
 
The orcs have no gear other than their [[Campaign Resources/Equipment/Weapons/Weapons\|Campaign Resources/Equipment/Weapons/Weapons]] and [[Root/Resources/Equipment/Armour/Armour\|Armour]]. If the drawbridge is lowered, they rush toward it and try to storm the village, killing other creatures in their path. If the drawbridge is raised, the orcs swim across the moat and try to climb the palisade, with no success. After being thwarted by the palisade, Gurrash sends scouts downriver to find another point of entry. It takes these ores 10 minutes to realize that they can enter the village through the gap in the palisade where the bridge (area 11) leads up to the keep. Once the ores enter the village, they fight to the death and don't take prisoners. Because the orcs don't know what they're up against, characters can try to hide in the village and pick off a few ores at a time. They can also retreat to the keep, which the orcs ignore.
 
If the orcs lose more than half their number without gaining a foothold in the village, the survivors flee into the surrounding hills. Once the ores are defeated, the characters can advance to 3rd level and head to the [[Root/Worlds/Faerun/Locations/Dripping Caves\|Dripping Caves]] to locate and retrieve the missing villagers. If they're not sure where the villagers went, [[Root/Worlds/Faerun/NPCs/Keila Darkhope\|Keila Darkhope]] or the [[Nightstone guards\|Nightstone guards]] in the keep can point them in the right direction.
 
**Encounter Blocks (Orcs)** ([CT: Combat Tracker])

# **Strange Bedfellows** 

If the characters came to terms with the [[Black Network\|Black Network]] in the previous event and the [[Root/Worlds/Faerun/StormKings Thunder/Seven Snakes\|Seven Snakes]] are still around when the ores arrive, the Zhents help the party defend [[Root/Worlds/Faerun/Locations/Nightstone\|Nightstone]]. Xolkin and Keila aren't heroes and don't place themselves in unnecessary danger, but they are quick to raise the drawbridge or position defenders on the watchtowers as needed. Knowing that orcs are devastating melee combatants, the Zhents favor ranged attacks and try to keep the orcs at a distance.
 

# **Elves to the Rescue!**

If the characters are in danger of being overwhelmed by War Chief Gurrash and his bloodthirsty orcs, eight elves of the [[Root/Worlds/Faerun/Locations/Ardeep Forest\|Ardeep Forest]] (CG male and female wood [[Elf\|Elf]] scouts) arrive from the north to assist them. The leader of this band is a daring wood [[Elf\|Elf]] named **Rond Arrowhome**. He and his fellow elves have no love or respect for the residents of [[Root/Worlds/Faerun/Locations/Nightstone\|Nightstone]], but they hate orcs more. Once the orcs are defeated, Rond yells out, "You're welcome!" before leading the elves back to the [[Root/Worlds/Faerun/Locations/Ardeep Forest\|Ardeep Forest]]. The elves aren't looking to pick a fight or mend fences with [[Root/Worlds/Faerun/Locations/Nightstone\|Nightstone]]'s inhabitants, and they aren't interested in any kind of reward.
