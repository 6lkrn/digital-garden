This is a splinter group of the [[Root/Worlds/Faerun/Factions/Order of the Gauntlet\|Order of the Gauntlet]] that originated in [[Root/Worlds/Faerun/Locations/Helm's Hold\|Helm's Hold]] (*Storm King’s Thunder*, Page 90-91) that have fallen into radical extremism. According to the Helm’s Hold entry, this group is convinced that Evil (Capital E Evil, the kind of Evil that’s more abstract than anything realistic) is rampant and it’s up to them to save the world from any influence that even smells one iota demonic.

In a classical sense, they became the Knights Templar. In my generation, they’re the source of the Satanic Panic group in the 80s. Today? They’re no doubt a millennial college student more interested in punching you for not thinking right then actually studying. There’s a good chance that some of them are already calling for my expulsion from the Dungeon Master’s Guild by now. If you need any extremist group who would burn a village to save it, call up [[Root/Worlds/Faerun/Factions/The Order of the Gilded Eye\|The Order of the Gilded Eye]].

The [[Root/Worlds/Faerun/Factions/Order of the Gauntlet\|Order of the Gauntlet]] knows of this group, and fears them. The [[Root/Worlds/Faerun/Factions/Order of the Gauntlet\|Order of the Gauntlet]] has doubled their instruction for their members to govern their hearts and ensure that their sense of Justice is leavened with a need for Compassion. They would talk about the proverbial Staring into the Abyss, and be careful not to *become* the Abyss which is the Gilded Eye. Unfortunately, they’re losing ground by one or two people, which makes the Gauntlet [[Fear\|fear]] that the Gilded Eye would envelop the entire Faction. When that happens, the other four [[Factions\|Factions]] would not abide by the new extremist Order, which will ultimately bring about open war with millions of common folk caught in the middle.

Unfortunately, that’s what the leader of the Gilded Eye faction, Holy Water Qerria, wants.
