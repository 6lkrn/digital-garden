House Xorlarrin is one of the few [[Drow\|Drow]] Houses that survived what happened in *Out of the Abyss* still intact. But only because they had enough sense to get out of Dodge when they found out what’s going to happen.

In my setting, one of the daughters of Matron Mother [[Root/Worlds/Faerun/NPCs/Zeerith Q'Xorlarrin\|Zeerith Q'Xorlarrin]] found out about [[Root/Worlds/Faerun/NPCs/Gromph Baernre\|Gromph Baernre]]’s ritual and she decided that, Lolth’s will or not, this is not going to be good for [[Menzoberranzan\|Menzoberranzan]]. So, the entire house exiled themselves over to Q’Xorlarrin. The other [[Drow\|Drow]] Houses were about to question House Xorlarrin on their actions when the ritual pulled eight demon lords into the [[Root/Worlds/Faerun/Locations/Underdark\|Underdark]], destroying the City of Spiders in the process.

I didn’t have anything to do with this ritual, honest.

From their base in [[Root/Worlds/Faerun/Locations/Q'Xorlarrin\|Q'Xorlarrin]], they plotted for a way to return to [[Menzoberranzan\|Menzoberranzan]] to rebuild the city and gain several levels of Station because of it. At first, they thought about overtaking [[Root/Worlds/Faerun/Locations/Gauntlgrym\|Gauntlgrym]], but they then switched to [[Root/Worlds/Faerun/Locations/Ironslag\|Ironslag]] so that they’ll have less meddling Dwarves bothering them. (But not without an attempt to steal Magera, the [[Dawn Titan\|Dawn Titan]] for their ends.)

I’ll be adding descriptions of House Xorlarrin members as they come up in future issues.
