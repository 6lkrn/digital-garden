The Hand of [[Root/Worlds/Faerun/Locations/Yartar\|Yartar]]

I’m going to lose some more of you with this entry. Shapely females in skimpy outfits is going to offend some people, and I’m way too old to give a fack about it. If a lady wants to wear a Chainmail Bikini or dress like Slave Leia, and it’s part of her personality, and it’s appropriate, and if some yahoo over at Twitter gripes about it, *she’s wearing it and that’s the way it is.*

I saw that the Hand of Yatar is an all-female group, picked up a couple Dungeon Masters Guild documents:

-   <u>The Unseen Hands Thieves Guild</u> <http://www.dmsguild.com/product/184902/>

-   <u>Big Book of Rogues</u> <http://www.dmsguild.com/product/183981/>

And ran with the theme of [[Root/Worlds/Faerun/Locations/Yartar\|Yartar]].

The Hand of Yatar is run by a quartet of succubi who, at one side, consider women to be the superior gender; while at the other deals with interlopers by putting them into cursed costumes (bending them into female genders if necessary) and breaking their minds into subservients or sex workers. Many a party who tried to stop them ended up being Bunny Girls in the Wink and Kiss club or sold as maids to less scrupulous people. Those they want to keep are spirited away into a pocket dimension of Shendilavri as their playthings for the rest of their lives.

Those they like are trained into being spies, rogues, assassins, and magical thieves. They are all given a uniform that resembles Zartana, and is enchanted to give the wearer some innate spellcasting, allowing her to cast *[[Campaign Resources/Magic/Spells/Invisibility\|Invisibility]]*, *[[Expeditious Retreat\|Expeditious Retreat]]*, and *[[Pass Without Trace\|Pass without Trace]]*. The costume also includes an eye mask with a built in *Sending Stone*, allowing her to communicate with her other members as well as their mistresses back in the Hall.

I’ll be remixing the Guildhall that Eric Hawley made in the above Dungeon Master’s Guild documents, as well as giving the leaders different names. I’m sure that he’ll appreciate that.
