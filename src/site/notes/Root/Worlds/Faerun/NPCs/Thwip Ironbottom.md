(Source: *Storm King’s Thunder*, page 92)
In the book, he’s a Rock [[Gnome\|Gnome]] [[Commoner\|Commoner]] residing in Hundelstone. In my version, he’s more than just a tinkerer; he’s one of the many Artificers in [[[../../../Worlds/Faerun/Locations/Luskan\|Luskan]]], as part of the City of Sails’ effort to join the [[Lord’s Alliance\|Lord’s Alliance]]. Instead of a mechanical bird, he’s the one to blame for including something that haven’t been seen since 3.5<sup>th</sup> Edition: The Iron Defender. This creature is a popular companion of Eberron’s Artificer in both 3.5<sup>th</sup> Edition D&D and the D&D Online MMORPG, and might return to the setting when Wizards returns to the setting with 5<sup>th</sup> Edition. Thwip’s version includes storage space and—since he’s a [[Gnome\|Gnome]]—a mount capacity as well as an ally in combat. This version of the Iron Defender will be playtested here and developed further in Æthercoil.

When you create a device, choose one of the following options:

-   **Fire Starter**. The device produces a miniature flame, which you can use to light a candle, torch, or campfire. Using the device requires your action.

Thwip is able to gather enough spare parts to inscribed a bunch of them with glyphs that allow him to build various mundane items on the fly. They are collected in a Gadget Pouch, included in his inventory. A Gadget Pouch weighs 5 lbs.
As an action, he can take any number of these parts to build any mundane item. They remain constructed until dismissed as a minor or taken more than 100 feet from Thwip, at that point the parts disassemble themselves and reappear in the bag. The Pouch has many parts equal to Thwip’s INT + His Level. Gadget Parts can be expended or destroyed, in which case, during any rest Thwip can spend a Spell Point to regain a Gadget Parts per action, 1 point per part.
Thwip can use the Adventuring Gear table on page 150 in the PH as a starting list of objects, except for [[Campaign Resources/Equipment/Potions/Magic Potions/Potion of Healing\|Potion of Healing]] or Antitoxin. He can construct an item at the rate of 1 Gadget Part per 10 GP rounded up, minimum of 1 Part. He can even make an arcane focus out of Gadget Parts.
For some of these items, the Gadget Part will be consumed, often by making consumable items or ammunition.
