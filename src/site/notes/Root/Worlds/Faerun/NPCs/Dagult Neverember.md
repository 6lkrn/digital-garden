Dagult Neverember in a Tyranny of Dragons-themed web comic from Wizards of the Coast

"My rumored personal dislike of Lord Neverember has nothing to do with my assessment of his leadership: I merely find him an intolerable flirt." -- Andwe Cururen, *Storm Coast Adventurer's Guide*

If there is *anyone* who would be like President Donald J. Trump, it would be the Lord Protector of [[Root/Worlds/Faerun/Locations/Neverwinter\|Neverwinter]]. Ever since 4th Edition, he's been wheeling and dealing—and in some cases weaseling and shmoozing—to "Make [[Root/Worlds/Faerun/Locations/Neverwinter\|Neverwinter]] Great Again." And from the looks of things, he did!

Yes, in my campaign world, he actually said that line. He'd put it on hats if he dared. Fortunately, unlike his real-world counterpart, Dagult Neverember has *class*. Didn't stop a Copper Dragon from running with it, though. But then again, would Donald J. Trump go up against *a dragon* one on one? Dagult has enough sense not to do so.

It wasn't without costs though. He tried unsuccessfully to combine being the Lord Protector of [[Root/Worlds/Faerun/Locations/Neverwinter\|Neverwinter]] with the Open Lord of [[Root/Worlds/Faerun/Locations/Waterdeep 1\|Waterdeep 1]], and nobody had the heart in them to tell Dagult in public that's not going to work well for long.

It was the more private council with his wife, Stephanie Alagondor, that caused him to swallow his pride and step down as the Open Lord, allowing that city to elect [[Root/Worlds/Faerun/NPCs/Laeral Silverhand\|Laeral Silverhand]] as the current Open Lord.

As this setting begins, the dust has settled in the aftermath of stepping down from [[Root/Worlds/Faerun/Locations/Waterdeep 1\|Waterdeep 1]], and Dagult resumed into his rule in the [[Root/Worlds/Faerun/Factions/Lord's Alliance\|Lord's Alliance]], spreading his belief in making the world a better place--in some cases in spite of itself. It is his goal to bring the major civilizations together through infrastructure, be it roads, telegraphs, and his upcoming dream of rail transport.

Of course, he’s doing this while dealing with the idea of including [[Root/Worlds/Faerun/Locations/Luskan\|Luskan]] into the [[Lord’s Alliance\|Lord’s Alliance]], with something he’d find a bit annoying pushing that idea onto him. Let’s just say that, with an exception of Drizzt, he had a bad experience with [[Drow\|Drow]], and that puts Jaraxle up in the air in Dagult’s mind.
