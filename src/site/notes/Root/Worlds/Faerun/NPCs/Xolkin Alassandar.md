# **Character History:**

Known as the [[Root/Worlds/Faerun/StormKings Thunder/Seven Snakes\|Seven Snakes]], Xolkin's band does "dirty work" for the Snail, a [Zhentarim](Worlds/Barovia/Factions/Zhentarim.md) leader based in [Daggerford](Daggerford.md) (see Nelkin Danniker). Their current mission is to help [[Keila Darkhope]]  turn [[Root/Worlds/Faerun/Locations/Nightstone\|Nightstone]] into a base for the [[Black Network\|Black Network]]. The settlement's defensibility and its proximity to [[Root/Worlds/Faerun/Locations/Waterdeep 1\|Waterdeep 1]] make it ideal for [[Root/Worlds/Faerun/Factions/Zhentarim\|Zhentarim]] operations.
 
The [[Root/Worlds/Faerun/StormKings Thunder/Seven Snakes\|Seven Snakes]] had planned to infiltrate the village posing as bounty hunters in search of a wanted criminal (Keila), but they drop the ruse once it becomes apparent that the village is mostly abandoned.
