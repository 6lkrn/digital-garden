# **Character History:**

Keila infiltrated [[Root/Worlds/Faerun/Locations/Nightstone\|Nightstone]] in the guise of a traveling monk and is waiting for [[Root/Worlds/Faerun/Factions/Zhentarim\|Zhentarim]] reinforcements to arrive (see the "[[[Seven Snakes\|[Seven Snakes]]]" section). She had nothing to do with the [[Cloud Giant\|Cloud Giant]] attack, but she intends to take over the village and turn it into a [[Black Network\|Black Network]] base. Her original plan was to drive away the Lionshield Coster and bully Lady [[Root/Worlds/Faerun/NPCs/Velrosa Nandar\|Velrosa Nandar]] into subservience, but the [[Cloud Giant\|Cloud Giant]] attack has left the abandoned village ripe for conquest while leaving its defenses more or less intact.
 
 

# **Combat Abilities:** 

Keila Darkhope, a [[Root/Worlds/Faerun/Factions/Zhentarim\|Zhentarim]] **spy** (NE female Spy, Chondathan [[Human\|Human]]), lurks in the shadows of this room-or what's left of it.
 
Keila isn't alone. The morning after the cloud giants attacked, a [[Flying Snake\|Flying Snake]] carrying a message from her Zhent associates arrived. The snake belongs to [[Root/Worlds/Faerun/NPCs/Xolkin Alassandar\|Xolkin Alassandar]] (see the "[[Root/Worlds/Faerun/StormKings Thunder/Seven Snakes\|Seven Snakes]]" section), and it now coils around Kella's left arm. Its message is scrawled in [[Common\|Common]] on a strip of parchment in Kella's possession. The message reads, "On our way."
 
Keila tries to remain hidden until the [[Root/Worlds/Faerun/StormKings Thunder/Seven Snakes\|Seven Snakes]] arrive. If discovered, she pretends to be a guest who was knocked unconscious by falling debris and left behind after the giant attack. She claims that her escape was thwarted by the sudden arrival of the goblins, whom she believes have nothing to do with the giants. Characters can see through her ruse with a successful Wisdom (Insight) check contested by Kella's Charisma (**Deception**) check. Any character who belongs to the [[Root/Worlds/Faerun/Factions/Zhentarim\|Zhentarim]] recognizes the [[Flying Snake\|Flying Snake]] as a symbol of that faction. Keila claims it is merely her pet.
