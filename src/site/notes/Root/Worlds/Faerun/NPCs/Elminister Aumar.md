I do not, by principle, include any well-known characters from the popular books in the setting. Don’t expect Drizzt or Elminster or Farideh anywhere in this notebook. And everybody says, thank the Gods. If a character from the books do show up here, it’s for a reason.

The less the Sage of Shadowdale appears in this setting, the more he likes it. “Finally,” I heard him say about me, “Someone I can shackle Volo with and have them both out of my hair!”
