Meriele was the proprietor of the Helm at Highsun and the city mage of [[Root/Worlds/Faerun/Locations/Red Larch\|Red Larch]], having inherited the place from her master, Yather Indaglol. She tends to stick to her studies, but will show up when the need is there. Like when there’s an Orb of Devastation that needs defusing. Or a couple kids in a sinkhole that need rescuing. She didn’t know what happened to Yather until they discovered his corpse in the Tomb of Moving Stones dungeon. (Princes of the Apocalypse, Chapter 6)

Meriele exacted revenge on the Believers and Larrakh afterward, casting [[Flesh to Stone\|Flesh to Stone]] on those who Constable Harburk couldn’t detain. By the time that some of her victims became marble statues (one became a fountain) in town—with the villager’s approval—the others surrendered to the authorities.

Some villagers wanted Meriele to be the new mayor, but she agreed to partner with Jalessa Ornra in this role.

Meriele presents herself as a graceful mystic with a velvet hand and an elegant air about herself. She’s is an adequate and diplomatic leader, although she tends to be creative when it comes to justice. She has taken in Braelen Hatherhand (Rescued from the Believers, of which his father was one.) as her apprentice.

Whatever or not Braelen was killed or petrified depends on the actions of the party.

Class Traits

**Arcane Recovery:** 1/day, at short rest, recover up to 8 Spell Points

**Transmutation Savant**: Transmutation spells costs half to copy.

**Minor Alchemy:** Starting at 2nd level when you select this school, you can temporarily alter the physical properties of one nonmagical object, changing it from one substance into another. Vou perform a special alchemical procedure on one object composed entirely of wood, stone (but not a gemstone), iron, copper, or silver, transforming it into a different one of those materials. For each 10 minutes you spend performing the procedure, you can transform up to 1 cubic foot of material. After 1 hour, or until you lose your concentration (as if you were concentrating on a spell), the material reverts to its original substance.

**Transmuter’s Stone:** Starting at 6th level, you can spend 8 hours creating a transmuter's stone that stores transmutation magic. You can benefit from the stone yourself or give it to another creature. A creature gains a benefit of your choice as long as the stone is in the creature's possession.

When you create the stone, choose one benefit from the following options:

-   [[Campaign Resources/Magic/Spells/Darkvision\|Campaign Resources/Magic/Spells/Darkvision]] out to a range of 60 feet, as described in chapter 8

-   An increase to speed of 1O feet while the creature is unencumbered

-   Proficiency in Constitution saving throws

-   [[Resistance\|Resistance]] to acid, cold, fire, lightning, or thunder damage (your choice whenever you choose this benefit)

Each time you cast a transmutation spell of 1st level or higher, you can change the effect of your stone if the stone is on your person.

If you create a new transmuter's stone, the previous one ceases to function.

**Shapechanger:** At 10th level, you add the *[[Polymorph\|Polymorph]]* spell to your spellbook, if it is not there already. 1/rest, You can cast [[Polymorph\|Polymorph]] without expending a spell slot. When you do so, you can target only yourself and transform into a beast whose challenge rating is 1 or lower.

**Master Transmuter:** Starting at 14th level, you can use your action to consume the reserve of transmutation magic stored within your transmuter's stone in a single burst. When you do so, choose one of the following effects. Your transmuter's stone is destroyed and can't be remade until you finish a long rest.

*Major Transformation:* You can transmute one nonmagical object (no larger than a 5-foot-cube) into another nonmagical object of similar [[Campaign Resources/Rules/5e/Combat/Size\|Campaign Resources/Rules/5e/Combat/Size]] and mass and of equal or lesser value. You must spend 10 minutes handling the object to transform it.

*Panacea:* You remove all curses, [[Campaign Resources/Rules/One Piece 5e/DM Screen/General Rules/Adventuring/Diseases\|Campaign Resources/Rules/One Piece 5e/DM Screen/General Rules/Adventuring/Diseases]], and [[Campaign Resources/Equipment/Items/Poisons\|Campaign Resources/Equipment/Items/Poisons]] affecting a creature that you touch with the transmuter's stone. The creature also regains all its hit points.

*Restore Life*: You cast the *[[Campaign Resources/Magic/Spells/Raise Dead\|Campaign Resources/Magic/Spells/Raise Dead]]* spell on a creature you touch with the transmuter's stone, without expending a spell slot or needing to have the spell in your spellbook.

*Restore Youth:* You touch the transmuter's stone to a willing creature, and that creature's apparent age is reduced by 3d1O years, to a minimum of 13 years. This effect doesn't extend the creature's lifespan.
