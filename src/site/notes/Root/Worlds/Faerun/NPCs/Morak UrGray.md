# **Character History:**

In the absence of a true leader, Morak Ur’gray (LG male shield [[Dwarf\|Dwarf]] commoner), the owner and proprietor of the [[Root/Worlds/Faerun/Locations/Nightstone\|Nightstone]] Inn, speaks on behalf of the villagers. Morak is an optimist, and he’s counting on Lady [[Root/Worlds/Faerun/NPCs/Velrosa Nandar\|Velrosa Nandar]] coming to the rescue. When he lays eyes on the adventurers, he breathes a sigh of relief and assumes they were hired by Lady Nandar. (He would be dismayed to learn that she didn’t survive the attack on [[Root/Worlds/Faerun/Locations/Nightstone\|Nightstone]].)
