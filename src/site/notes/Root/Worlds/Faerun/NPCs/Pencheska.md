The Succubus of [[Root/Worlds/Faerun/Locations/Daggerford\|Daggerford]]. Only a small group in town know that she's really a succubus, and keep an eye on her because of that. But most people just know her as the proverbial “Whore with a Heart of Gold.” (Sometimes those Tropes do fit.) She owns the [[Silver Flood\|Silver Flood]] where she lives…and runs a brothel hidden in the back.

In my version, she doesn't have any part in the intrigues in either modules she's in (*Scourge of the Sword Coast* or *Storm King’s Thunder*) but can give the party a clue in the right direction…for a price. Girl has to do what she can to get by, after all.

She also has a warlock, [[Tasha\|Tasha]], who runs [[Root/Worlds/Faerun/Locations/Naerythar Castle\|Naerythar Castle]].
