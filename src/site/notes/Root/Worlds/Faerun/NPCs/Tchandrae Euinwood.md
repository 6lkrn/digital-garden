Tchandrae EUINWOOD

Elminister found out about Tchandrae when she was just a child, but couldn’t find any decent means to mentor her and her innate [[Legend Lore\|Legend Lore]] ability. He referred her to Storm Silverhand who were better suited to the need. Because of Storm’s guidance, Tchandrae is a Level 5 Bard of Lore who can use [[Legend Lore\|Legend Lore]] CHA/day.
