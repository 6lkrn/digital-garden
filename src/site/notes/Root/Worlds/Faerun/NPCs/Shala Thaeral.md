Shala is known in [[Kheldell\|Kheldell]] as ‘The Voice of the Circle,’ and the spokesperson for the Dusk Circle of druids. She and [[Root/Worlds/Faerun/NPCs/Ghelkyn Stormwind\|Ghelkyn Stormwind]] talk to each other often, officially over where the Dusk Circle doesn’t mind loggers being, and unofficially over many other things. They might have a relationship together.
