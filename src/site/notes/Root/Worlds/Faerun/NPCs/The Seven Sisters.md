*Sources: <u>The Seven Sisters</u>*
The fabled Seven Sisters of Faerunian legend, some of them have disappeared and thought perished during the Spellplague, have resurfaced in the Post-Sundering era. This includes the reveal of the previously unknown seventh sister: Quile Valadorn, the [[Drow\|Drow]] Priestess of [[Root/Worlds/Faerun/NPCs/Eilistraee\|Eilistraee]], who fled to the surface due to events in Out of the Abyss.
They are much needed in the setting. Forces are out there threatening to destroy everything, and while Faerun has plenty of adventurers to deal with the threat, they lack guidance and direction. The Seven Sisters have those two qualities in spades.
The Seven Sisters consist of the following (They will have their own separate entries when they appear):

1.  [[Root/Worlds/Other worlds/NPCs/Alustriel\|Alustriel]], the Shining Lady, a mentor in [[Root/Worlds/Faerun/Locations/Silverymoon\|Silverymoon]] and instructor of Magic.

2.  [[Root/Worlds/Faerun/NPCs/Dove Falconhand\|Dove Falconhand]], prodigiously strong fighter, built like Overwatch’s Zarya who roams the realm looking for…exercise.

3.  [[Root/Worlds/Faerun/NPCs/Laeral Silverhand\|Laeral Silverhand]], Open Lord of Waterdeep

4. [[ Alassra\| Alassra]], the Simbul of [[Aglarond\|Aglarond]], a warrior-wizard who wanders the realms in many disgises.

5.  [[Storm Silverhand\|Storm Silverhand]], the current leader of the [[Root/Worlds/Faerun/Factions/Harpers\|Harpers]]

6.  [[Sylune\|Sylune]], the Witch of [[Shadowdale\|Shadowdale]], who somehow regained a physical body during the Sundering. Was it a side effect of the realms-shaking event, was she reincarnated, or something else?

7.  [[Root/Worlds/Faerun/NPCs/Quille Veladorn\|Quille Veladorn]], the formerly unknown member of the Seven, surprising everyone that she’s a [[Drow\|drow]] priestess of [[Root/Worlds/Faerun/NPCs/Eilistraee\|Eilistraee]], and becoming the second name on the lips of people who say “Not all [[Drow\|Drow]] are like that.”
