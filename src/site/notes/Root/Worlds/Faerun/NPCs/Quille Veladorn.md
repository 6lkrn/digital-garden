The High Priestess of [[Root/Worlds/Faerun/NPCs/Eilistraee\|Eilistraee]], she hasn't been seen (as well as the other members of [[Root/Worlds/Faerun/NPCs/The Seven Sisters\|The Seven Sisters]]) since before the spellplague. She has reappeared (as expected for the others) because the Elven race in a crisis with the rise of the [[Root/Worlds/Other worlds/NPCs/Eldreth Valuuthra\|Eldreth Valuuthra]]. In this campaign setting, she is the Chosen of the Dark Maiden, which gives her some abilities (including innate spells) beyond the capacity of any normal Cleric/Bladesinger.

In her ends of curtailing the surge of Elven Supremacy, she has set up a base at the [[Root/Worlds/Faerun/Locations/Dancing Dell\|Dancing Dell]] in the [[Root/Worlds/Faerun/Locations/Ardeep Forest\|Ardeep Forest]], and has reached out to Lord [[Root/Worlds/Barovia/NPCs/Darfin Floshin\|Darfin Floshin]] and forged a relationship that will help each other’s goals. Qilue doesn’t know how farther this relationship goes, but she can sense some feelings for the Sun [[Elf\|Elf]]. At times she does see herself becoming his bride, but that’s up to the Dark Maiden to decide.

Æthercoil Magazine has a prestige class of Bladesinger that can work with other magic-casting classes, including Clerics. This combination makes for the Sworddancer combination that [[Root/Worlds/Faerun/NPCs/Eilistraee\|Eilistraee]] fosters.
