I do not, by principle, include any well-known characters from the popular books in the setting. You will not see Drizzt or Elminster or Farideh in this setting. And everybody say, thank the Gods. If a character from the books do show up, is for a reason.

Such is the case for the leader of the Bregan D’aerthe mercenary company based in [[Root/Worlds/Faerun/Locations/Luskan\|Luskan]]. He's angling to become a part of the [[Root/Worlds/Faerun/Factions/Lord's Alliance\|Lord's Alliance]] by spearheading the effort to include the controversial city into the faction, which is much needed since the faction lost two city members—[[Root/Worlds/Faerun/Locations/Everlund\|Everlund]] and [[Root/Worlds/Faerun/Locations/Sundabar\|Sundabar]] and would much needed any shot of fresh blood. Neverember has visited [[Root/Worlds/Faerun/Locations/Luskan\|Luskan]] and talked with Jarlaxle (albeit with someone nearby with sword at hand; Jarlaxle doesn’t have Drizzt’s good graces) about the move to include [[Root/Worlds/Faerun/Locations/Luskan\|Luskan]] into the Alliance, but the other members of the group are still very wary.
