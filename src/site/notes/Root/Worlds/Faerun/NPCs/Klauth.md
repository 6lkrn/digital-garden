I have a philosophy of “No Two Dragons are Alike,” which allows me to give some dragons unique personalities and permission to do things that just aren’t expected for Dragons to do (or for that matter, dragons of a certain color.) A Dragon who kidnapped a princess might actually be that princess’ chosen champion, and the party would find the dragon curled up listening to her reading to him in his lair (who would then warn the party that the King is becoming too overcontrolling, who is the real big bad of the adventure.)

Such is the case with Old Snarl here, very vicious when it comes to other dragons, but nice to humans. I could see the Red Dragon—of all monsters—owing the party a favor and will come to their aid in return for an earlier good deed.
