Volothamp GEDDARM

VOLO:  
Heeeeeelp! Elminister! Save me from this crazy nutter!!

ELMINISTER:  
Ha, ha. Finally! Someone I can saddle you with and you both will stay out of my hair!

DAVID FOXFIRE:  
Thanks a lot, you old coot!

Yes. Sometimes I do write in script form. And include a surprise fiction scene in some points. Especially for comedy. (Also, I get a kick out of triggering grammar police by starting sentences with ‘and’ and ending them in prepositions. Humor me.)
