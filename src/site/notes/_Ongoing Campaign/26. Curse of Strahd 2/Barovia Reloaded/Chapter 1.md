Chapter 1: Into the Mists   


Triggers & Accommodations 

Redemption—The Angel's Feather 

A player seeking redemption begins the campaign with the angel's feather, a large, snow-white feather. When viewed beneath the light of the morning sun, the feather's barbs glimmer like gold. 

Unbeknownst to the player, the angel's feather formerly belonged to Lumiel, a deva that serves the god Lathander, who is known to his followers as the [[Worlds/Barovia/NPCs/Morninglord\|Morninglord]]. Lumiel is the true name of [[Worlds/Barovia/NPCs/The Abbot\|The Abbot]], who dwells in the Abbey of Saint Markovia in [[Worlds/Barovia/Locations/Barovia\|Barovia]]. When it senses the presence of Death House, the feather is swept away by an unseen wind, its barbs glimmering with golden light, before eventually landing on  the house's threshold. 

The player who possesses the angel's feather should have strong, vivid reasons to believe that the feather will one day lead them to penance for the sins that they have committed. 

Developments. When the players first arrive at the Abbey in Act IV, Arc N: The [[Resources/Equipment/Artifacts/Holy Symbol of Ravenkind\|Holy Symbol of Ravenkind]] or Act IV, Arc Q: A Bride for [[Worlds/Barovia/NPCs/Strahd von Zarovich\|Strahd]], the angel's feather glimmers and is swept away in the same way that it did upon sensing Death House, guiding the player toward [[Worlds/Barovia/NPCs/The Abbot\|The Abbot]]. [[Worlds/Barovia/NPCs/The Abbot\|The Abbot]] recognizes the feather as his own, but dismisses its  importance. 

# The Scarf of Fate 

The [[Worlds/Barovia/Factions/Vistani\|Vistani]] have a tradition of their wise women weaving a scarf of fate. This scarf has carried on for many generations, with each generation weaving a small portion that tells their history and their stories.  It is a multi-coloured scarf woven with complex patterns. The fabric is soft and warm, and is long enough to be draped around the shoulders or worn over one's head. When bright sunlight, moonlight, or starlight is allowed to pass through it, the patterns seem to shimmer and twist in eerie and beautiful ways. 

When it senses the presence of the Moon Gem, the scarf glows and unravels in a web of strings. Anyone who touches these strings can then view the visions and stories hidden within. The scarf is in actuality the [[Scarf of Faith\|Scarf of Faith]], dedicated to the [[Worlds/Barovia/NPCs/Mother Night 1\|Mother Night 1]] but the name was lost to history.  

Developments. When the players earn the trust of [[Worlds/Barovia/NPCs/Ezmerelda\|Ezmerelda]], she beseeches them to help her find it and get it back. If they manage to retrieve it, [[Worlds/Barovia/NPCs/Ezmerelda\|Ezmerelda]] will bestow upon them the [[Worlds/Barovia/Factions/Vistani\|Vistani]] honour of calling them "cousin", making them a part of the [[Worlds/Barovia/Factions/Vistani\|Vistani]] family and promising them support and help in the future.  

# The Dragon's Scale 

[[Worlds/Barovia/NPCs/Argynvost\|Argynvost]]'s Knights took 7 scales from the dead dragons body. They vowed to use these as a momento of the dragon's sacrifice and knights eternal pledge. All 7 scales and the dragons heart have been lost. Any creature that touches it feels a deep sense of longing, loss, and hope.  

Developments. When the player first encounters [[Worlds/Barovia/NPCs/Argynvost\|Argynvost]]'s shadow in the foyer of [[Worlds/Barovia/Locations/Argynvostholt\|Argynvostholt]] in Act IV, Arc O: The Beacon of [[Worlds/Barovia/Locations/Argynvostholt\|Argynvostholt]], the scale briefly burns cold and glows. Each time the player approaches a manifestation of [[Worlds/Barovia/NPCs/Argynvost\|Argynvost]]'s spirit, the scale burns cold and glows with a bright, silver light in the direction of the manifestation. 
If the player helps to retrieve [[Worlds/Barovia/NPCs/Argynvost\|Argynvost]]'s skull and restore it to his crypt, [[Worlds/Barovia/NPCs/Argynvost\|Argynvost]]'s spirit greets the player warmly, naming them his heir to the legacy of the Order of the Silver Dragon before lighting the beacon of [[Worlds/Barovia/Locations/Argynvostholt\|Argynvostholt]]. 

# The Amber Shard 

A player seeking knowledge begins the campaign with the amber shard, a small chunk of amber resin mounted on a chain-link cord. The shard is inset with complex, three dimensional arcane runes. When viewed under the detect magic spell, it exudes a strong aura of abjuration magic.  

Unbeknownst to the player, the amber shard was formerly a part of a dark vestige's amber sarcophagus in the [[Worlds/Barovia/Locations/Amber Temple\|Amber Temple]] in [[Worlds/Barovia/Locations/Barovia\|Barovia]]. When it senses the presence of [[Worlds/Barovia/Locations/Amber Temple\|Amber Temple]], it glows with amber light and tugs its cord in the direction of the house. 

Developments. In Act I, Arc A: Escape From [[Worlds/Barovia/Locations/Death House\|Death House]], the player recognizes Elisabeth Durst's amber shard as similar in appearance to their own. In Act II, Arc G: The Strazni Siblings, the player recognizes [[Worlds/Barovia/NPCs/Izek Strazni\|Izek Strazni]]'s amber shard in a similar way. In Act V, Arc U, Elder Burebis of Soldav can recognize the amber shard as a shard of evil taken from the [[Worlds/Barovia/Locations/Amber Temple\|Amber Temple]], and the player can recognize the amber shards kept by the shoosuva and bodaks as resembling their own. 

If the player character is reduced to 0 hit points in [[Worlds/Barovia/Locations/Barovia\|Barovia]] while in possession of their amber shard, it behaves as described in Appendix B: The Amber Shards, offering the player an opportunity to forge a pact with a vestige of the [[Worlds/Barovia/Locations/Amber Temple\|Amber Temple]] that fits the player character's personality, flaws, and temptations. Upon entering the [[Worlds/Barovia/Locations/Amber Temple\|Amber Temple]], the player's amber shard glows and tugs, guiding the player toward a suitable amber sarcophagus.   
# The Wolf's Tooth 

The wolf's tooth is a tooth coated with clear resin and mounted on a leather cord. The tooth seems to lengthen and sharpen on nights of the full moon, and calms its wearer's dreams when worn at night. 

This tooth belongs to [[Fenrath\|Fenrath]]. The first werewolf and follower of [[Worlds/Barovia/NPCs/Mother Night 1\|Mother Night 1]]. It is worn by the leader of the werewolf clans. Currently the tooth has been stolen by [[Worlds/Barovia/NPCs/Baron Vargas Vallakovich\|Baron Vargas Vallakovich]]. The wolves will want it recovered. The clans are broken into two factions and without the tooth the wolves will not decide who must truly be in charge. 

Unbeknownst to the player, the tooth once belonged to a wolfir—a werewolf that served the fey goddess known as the Huntress before her gift of lycanthropy was twisted into a curse. The Huntress's holy place, the Forest Fane, dwells amidst the woodlands of [[Worlds/Barovia/Locations/Barovia\|Barovia]], silently waiting to be restored. When it senses the presence of [[Worlds/Barovia/Locations/Death House\|Death House]], the tooth lengthens, glowing with silver moonlight, and tugs its cord in the direction of the house. 

The player who possesses the wolf's tooth should have strong, vivid reasons to believe that the tooth is the key to curing a particular wound, malady, or curse that ails them. 

Developments. If the player shows the wolf's tooth to Kavan in Act III, Arc K: The Missing Gem or to Elder Burebis in Act V, Arc W: The Ladies of the Fanes, the tooth is recognized as an artifact and symbol of the Huntress. When the player first approaches the circle of stones at the Forest Fane in Act V, Arc W: The Ladies of the Fanes, the tooth lengthens and glows with moonlight as it did upon sensing [[Worlds/Barovia/Locations/Death House\|Death House]]. 

Even if the players help the wolves retrieve their tooth, they will not betray [[Worlds/Barovia/NPCs/Strahd von Zarovich\|Strahd]] easily. 

# The Crumpled Page 

A player seeking power begins the campaign with the crumpled page, an old, yellowed page that was torn from its book long ago. The page is written in strange and cryptic arcane runes; those few runes that can be decoded speak of a path that leads to immortality and untold power. 

Unbeknownst to the player, the page was taken from the library of [[Worlds/Barovia/NPCs/Exethanter\|Exethanter]], a lich who dwells in the deepest sanctum of the [[Worlds/Barovia/Locations/Amber Temple\|Amber Temple]] in [[Worlds/Barovia/Locations/Barovia\|Barovia]]. When it senses the presence of [[Worlds/Barovia/Locations/Death House\|Death House]], the ink on the page glows with amber light, the runes reshaping themselves into a map that leads to the lich. 

Developments. When the player first approaches [[Worlds/Barovia/NPCs/Exethanter\|Exethanter]]'s library in Act V, Arc U: The [[Worlds/Barovia/Locations/Amber Temple\|Amber Temple]], the ink glows with amber light as it did upon sensing Death 
House, and the runes reshape themselves into a map of [[Worlds/Barovia/NPCs/Exethanter\|Exethanter]]'s chambers and nearby access points. If the player shows the page to [[Worlds/Barovia/NPCs/Exethanter\|Exethanter]] after restoring his memories in the same arc, [[Worlds/Barovia/NPCs/Exethanter\|Exethanter]] grows warmer and friendlier toward that player. 

# The Raven's Feather 

A player seeking duty begins the campaign with a raven's feather, a small, black feather with soft, downy barbs. When held aloft before a storm, the feather seems to gently tremble, exuding the scent of cold rain and damp earth. 

Unbeknownst to the player, the feather once belonged to the roc of [[Worlds/Barovia/Locations/Mount Ghakis\|Mount Ghakis]], a servant of the fey goddess known as the Seeker, whose Mountain Fane rests in the shadow of [[Worlds/Barovia/Locations/Mount Ghakis\|Mount Ghakis]] in [[Worlds/Barovia/Locations/Barovia\|Barovia]]. The roc once enjoyed disguising itself as a common raven, and shed this feather on one such occasion. 

Developments. If the player shows the raven's feather to [[Worlds/Barovia/NPCs/Madam Eva\|Madam Eva]] in Act I, Arc C: Into the Valley, she inspects it reverently and returns it to the player, claiming mysteriously that she once knew the bird that shed it. If the player shows the feather to [[Worlds/Barovia/NPCs/Urwin Martikov\|Urwin Martikov]], [[Worlds/Barovia/NPCs/Danika Martikov\|Danika Martikov]], [[Worlds/Barovia/NPCs/Muriel Martikov\|Muriel Vinshaw]], or any other member of the [[Worlds/Barovia/Factions/Keepers of the Feather\|Keepers of the Feather]], that member grows warmer and friendlier toward that player. 

When the player first enters the circle of standing stones at the Mountain Fane in Act V, Arc W: The Ladies of the Fanes, the feather trembles and the air around it briefly grows thick with the scent of rain and ozone as it did upon sensing [[Worlds/Barovia/Locations/Death House\|Death House]]. If the player shows the feather to the Roc of [[Worlds/Barovia/Locations/Mount Ghakis\|Mount Ghakis]] after consecrating the Mountain Fane in the same arc, the roc places the tip of its beak against the player's forehead as a sign of gratitude and approval before departing. 


# The Sunrise Medallion 

A player seeking faith begins the campaign with the sunrise medallion, a bronze disc engraved with the image of a rising sun. The disc glitters like gold when exposed to the light of the sunrise, and a Good-aligned creature that touches it feels a fleeting sense of reverence, righteousness, and peace. 

Unbeknownst to the player, the medallion once belonged to [[Worlds/Barovia/NPCs/Sergei von Zarovich\|Sergei von Zarovich]], the brother of [[Worlds/Barovia/NPCs/Strahd von Zarovich\|Strahd von Zarovich]] and an acolyte of the Church of the [[Worlds/Barovia/NPCs/Morninglord\|Morninglord]] who was once expected to become its Most High Priest. When it senses the presence of [[Worlds/Barovia/Locations/Death House\|Death House]], the medallion shines with a warm, golden glow, the rays of sunlight emanating from the engraved sun pointing in the direction of the house. 

The player who possesses the sunrise medallion should have strong, vivid reasons to believe that it will strengthen or guide them in faith, and that certain signs of the divine will lead them to those in need of salvation and deliverance. 

Developments. When the player first approaches St. [[Worlds/Barovia/NPCs/Andral\|Andral]]'s Church in Act II, Arc D: St. [[Worlds/Barovia/NPCs/Andral\|Andral]]'s Feast, the sunrise medallion glows and shines in the direction of the church's doors. If the player shows the sunrise medallion to Father [[Worlds/Barovia/NPCs/Donavich\|Donavich]] or Lucian, they recognize it as a symbol of the [[Worlds/Barovia/Locations/Church of Barovia\|Church of Barovia]] of the [[Worlds/Barovia/NPCs/Morninglord\|Morninglord]] and grow warmer and friendlier toward that player. 

# The Stone Crest 

A player seeking harmony begins the campaign with the stone crest, a flat, round stone engraved with the image of a three-pointed star. On the nights of the new moon, the star seems to glimmer with emerald light. 

Unbeknownst to the player, the crest once belonged to a spiritual leader among the First Folk, the people who first settled the land of [[Worlds/Barovia/Locations/Barovia\|Barovia]] long ago, and who have now divided into the Forest Folk (who are loyal to [[Worlds/Barovia/NPCs/Strahd von Zarovich\|Strahd]]) and the Mountain Folk (who are not). The engravings upon it depict the symbols of the Seeker, the Weaver, and the Huntress—the three fey goddesses that the First Folk once called the Rozana, or Ladies Three. When it senses the presence of [[Worlds/Barovia/Locations/Death House\|Death House]], the crest emits a low hum and releases a scent of pine needles and earthy soil, which both grow stronger as the player approaches the house. 

The player who possesses the stone crest should have strong, vivid reasons to believe that the symbols upon it represent a primal or divine power of harmony and nature, and that the crest can aid them in restoring the sanctity of wild places. 

Developments. When the player first approaches the exterior of Soldav in Act V, Arc W: The Ladies of the Fanes, the stone crest hums and releases a scent of pine needles and earth soil as it did upon sensing [[Worlds/Barovia/Locations/Death House\|Death House]], both of which grow stronger as the player approaches the Shrine of the Rozana in Soldav. 

If the player shows the stone crest to Kavan in Act III, Arc K: The Missing Gem or to Elder Burebis in Act V, Arc W: The Ladies of the Fanes, the crest is recognized as an artifact and symbol of the Ladies of the Fanes. 

# The Broken Blade 

A player seeking justice begins the campaign with the broken blade, the shattered tip of a longsword. The blade is engraved with the sigil of a lion rampant, which seems to roar when the light of dusk touches it. 

Unbeknownst to the player, the blade once belonged to Erevan, a dusk elf prince. Erevan, a master bladesinger, practiced the style of the lion, which he also used as his personal sigil. However, Erevan refused to pay tribute to [[Worlds/Barovia/NPCs/King Barov\|King Barov]] von Zarovich, a powerful warlord and the father of [[[[Strahd von Zarovich\|Strahd]] von Zarovich|[[Stra\|Stra]]hd von Zarovich]]. 

[[Worlds/Barovia/NPCs/Rahadin\|Rahadin]], a dusk elf who had spurned Erevan's rule, helped [[Worlds/Barovia/NPCs/King Barov\|King Barov]] conquer the dusk elf kingdom. [[Worlds/Barovia/NPCs/Rahadin\|Rahadin]] then broke Erevan's blade and personally executed Erevan and his family as punishment for his defiance. 

Developments. If the player shows the broken blade to [[Worlds/Barovia/NPCs/Kasimir Velikov\|Kasimir Velikov]] in Act V, Arc U: The [[Worlds/Barovia/Locations/Amber Temple\|Amber Temple]], he mournfully recalls its history and asks the player how they came to possess it. If the player informs [[Worlds/Barovia/NPCs/Kasimir\|Kasimir]] of how they came to inherit it, [[Worlds/Barovia/NPCs/Kasimir\|Kasimir]] greets them as family, wondering aloud if more of the dusk elves may have escaped [[Worlds/Barovia/NPCs/Strahd von Zarovich\|Strahd]]'s slaughter outside of [[Worlds/Barovia/Locations/Barovia\|Barovia]]. 

If the broken blade is ever in close proximity to [[Worlds/Barovia/NPCs/Rahadin\|Rahadin]], [[Worlds/Barovia/NPCs/Strahd von Zarovich\|Strahd]]'s chamberlain, it emits a high-pitched hum and trembles violently, spinning like a compass needle in his direction just as it did upon sensing [[Worlds/Barovia/Locations/Death House\|Death House]]. If the player shows the broken blade to [[Worlds/Barovia/NPCs/Rahadin\|Rahadin]], he at first claims to have no memory of it, noting dispassionately the 

thousands that he has slaughtered. However, in combat, [[Worlds/Barovia/NPCs/Rahadin\|Rahadin]] eventually comes to remember the blade's origins, dismissing it as "the shattered toy of a weak and worthless man."
