    Mercy's Backstory Part 1 The character I'm playing is named Mercutio Macness. The were the youngest of four siblings. The firstborn is a sister of theirs, the second born would always argue with their twin whoever came first. One male and female. Lastly, them. Mercutio 'Mercy' Macness. By the time the y were born, the parents has already established their hospital and clinics across the island. this prompted them to move quite alot. Which in effect made Mercy's childhood to be revolving around their parents work. They did not even attend schooling like their siblings did. rather they were tutored by whoever's available during their parents' stay. Exposure to the profession at such an early rate, allowed them to be known among the staffs of various clinics and hospitals. Though that was not the only thing they were exposed to. There were moments that they can afford their own time. By which they took it as a time to distance themselves from the medicines and patients. Taking a leisure stroll here and there. The land of Chryxdesence were magical to say the least. proof of which by the present inhabitants of the lands. Nymphs, dryads, Sirens Fox spirits, whatever more spirits that were present there. All of which under the purview of the White Lord or Pale Lord whichever people would refer to the higher being in the land. Their relation to the denizens of the forest were quite genial. As whenever they had the time, they would enjoy talking about the recent events of the whole island. of which the nymphs always liked to share. Such rampant gossipers they were. Life is both calm and extraordinary at the same time. In short. downright magical. The island of Chryxdesence were under the control of the Navy, or rather the Empire of New Kunaan. As such, the presence of the navy were commonplace in the port city of Chryxtalia.

    part 2 The island of Chryxdesence were under the control of the Navy, or rather the Empire of New Kunaan. As such, the presence of the navy were commonplace in the port city of Chryxtanza. Though one time, the navy ships that came into the port were... let's just say, more extravagant than normal. The ships were bigger, also the notable people present in the port city. Something significant has happened in the navy as they were all in a celebratory mood. in comparison to before which was all business. Safe to say the festivities took the better part of the week. Nothing seems to be an issue aside from the increased noise level. All of that changed however when one member disappeared. a very notable one. by which the navy presence in the island were fully utilized to scour the land to find their missing comrade. They neither cared of flora and fauna of the land even the ecosystem of the island were disturbed by their ruthless search. They did found the missing person in the end, it was supposed to be the end of it. Until they called upon Mercy's family to use their expertise in medicine to heal whatever ailments suffered by the navy. The process took several months, it was severely taxing to the family. Just as there were signs of recovery, tragedy struck when the navy personnel were found dead in their hospital bed. Safe to say the navy were not pleased with the result. Of which they delivered an ultimatum to the family. Either the whole island suffer the full might of the navy or sacrifice one member of the Macness family as a scapegoat. A sacrificial lamb. Mercy saw the impact of said ultimatum firsthand on their parents. Unable to bear to see them suffer, Mercy volunteered. much to the chagrin of their parents. especially their own mother.

    Part 3 Once the answer was delivered, they were given a month to prepare for their banishment. Aside from the grievances from their family, they did not put much on their mind. As most of their friends, especially those that are in tuned with nature would warn them of their incoming... separation? no, withdrawal. They prepared as best as they could, but when the moment comes... safe to say that Mercy was forever changed. They lost their healthy look, adopting a sickly and lethargic form. not so different from that of an addict just needing their next fix.

    Nova's backstory Hailing from the seaside province of Canton in the Middle Kingdom, Yang Nova had quite the mundane childhood, despite his… ancestry. He was born, got dumped onto his father by his mother, grew up, went to school, got kicked out of school, and thus spent most of his childhood helping his father. His family isn’t big, but it isn’t small either, consisting of five members:
    
    - Simon Yang Zhu Ho (阳朱河), his father,
    - Mituna Yang Zhang Yi (阳张翼), his eldest brother,
    - Sollux Yang Yi Ho (阳二河), his elder brother,
    - Yang Xing (阳星), his twin sister,
    - And of course, him—阳诺洼. But he doubts people can pronounce that properly, so just call him Nova.
    
    (There’s also his mother, of course, but she isn’t too important; she was practically never home, anyways.) Nova’s always been a problem child: from a young age, he was getting into fights left and right. Predictably, he wasn’t very well-liked for this–not that he cared–which may or may not have led to him nearly getting drowned as a “prank”. He left home as soon as he was old enough, following his mother onto her ship to learn what life’s like at sea. When he decided he had a good grasp on it, he left, looking for a crew that’s unaffiliated with her instead. And this is how he joined—in a bar, he escalated an already tense situation between the crew and some people, resulting in everyone being thrown out for fighting. Though a bit of a knucklehead, his martial prowess is no joke–he came out of it unscathed, relative to those who met his fists–and was willing to accept a lower pay/loot portion and higher workload in order to join.

    **Sesh notes.** So with the crew gone, Mercy is left with the dog. They decided to go around the city to get a better layout of it. It's very structured, better than holte's Island. the districts are only 3: farms with unknown crops, industrial for construction n maintenance, n residential no shopping lots, no parks or anything. went to the tower, found armies of zombies in there in a massive hangar, estimation once going through it all, 100k in numbers (at least) the soldiers zombo smelt like ink, found a room where the zombie made the ink. **(level -18)** found Dard in the dungeon. lvl 70-ish (lost count tbh) The guy did not cast the illusion, we were duped there. got trapped. got insulted by the person in charge, could be tuesday, could be not. (idk & idc) someone else is with the PIC, it's the same guy that worked with Father Flow. (head sunpriest from 1st island) got out. (lots of metal sheets) found the crew, being tortured by zombo scientists. crew about to be injected with massive syringes with dark liquid inside. (possibly the ink stuff) killed all the scientists present. so now we're gathered together.
