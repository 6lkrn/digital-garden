### About Mahtaa Waan

The deity Mahtaa Waan is a deity of Commerce and Wealth, reigning over the domain of trickery, knowledge and war. The deity is mostly Chaotic Neutral (Yes, everything you do is for you!) or Neutral (Sometimes you just need to let yourself go) at best.

Mahtaa Waan is the reason for Bambangan’s rise to fame, from a shoddy village to a lavish, bustling port town. Mata Wang ([[Campaign Resources/Rules/Currency\|Campaign Resources/Rules/Currency]]) is the way of Mahtaa Waan and can be seen all throughout Bambangan.

A cleric of Mahtaa Waan may not be able to access excessive indulgence, but you are able to connect with a multitude of people and build yourself a successful career!

For the ones uninterested in spreading the good word of Mahtaa Waan, you can sell Mahtaa Waan *religious paraphernalia! These items are guaranteed to fly off the shelves every single time you showcase them. They can even be useful for people who are not of the faith, so you will never lose customers.

The deity Mahtaa Waan will come to the most pious of the followers in an everchanging form, with the most prominent one being a cat with a golden plate on one paw.

Don’t worry, Mahtaa Waan does not bite.

LET MAHTAA WAAN IN YOUR HEART TODAY!

For more information, contact your local Mahtaa Waan cleric or Gapura.

*all followers would be asked to keep the symbol (or an iteration) of Mahtaa Waan on their person/near them.

# Mahtaa Waan 

- Came as a prophetic dream to Girihana (later becoming the Sibyl of Mahtaa Waan) who later claimed [[Worlds/PCs/Rasian\|Rasian]] will play a huge part in the religion.
    
- Minor future sight, glamour, ability enhancement, and telepathy.
    
- Probably eats money
    
- Religious paraphernalia contains spells that would allow [[Worlds/Other worlds/NPCs/Mahtaa Waan\|Mahtaa Waan]] to spy on people/place
    
- Another prominent form is probably sphinx lol
    
- Was actually the one who started the war near [[Worlds/PCs/Rasian\|Rasian]]’s place
