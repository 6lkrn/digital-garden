One of the real world political hang-ups is the tendency of some groups to call other people racists because of having a belief that their country is all right or wears a certain cap, or rather vote for a real estate developer turned reality television host. To those people who have a Pavlovian tendency to invoke Goodwin’s Law in real world debate, allow me to introduce what a real racial supremacist looks like.

Punch a member of Eldreth Valuuthra at your peril.

In my setting, I will use the Eldreth Valuuthra as a Big Bad Group whenever there is a need for one (and one isn’t present in any campaign.) The Eldreth Valuuthra is convinced that the Sword Coast used to be their own Elven Kingdom, and that all the other [[Races\|Races]], including humans, and especially half-elves, are impurities in their world and should be eradicated. Right now, they’re just doing various massacres and intrigues, but they wouldn’t mind at all if they want to set up their own Holocaust—with the camps and everything—to get what they want. They will certainly be behind many atrocities, including the ones depicted in my revision of Scourge of the Sword Coast.

If the Eldreth Valuuthra’s plans ever reached the general population’s knowledge. It is up to all five of the main [[Factions\|Factions]] to stomp this group. Flat.
