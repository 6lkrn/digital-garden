Los Calorus

  [[25. The Last Calzone\|25. The Last Calzone]]
  

Its 1920s and the city of food has been invaded with unhealthy sugar from foreign countries

The government has banned sugar and soda to try and stop it but this has just lead to criminal gangs popping up. You play as one of these criminal gangs.

Everyone in the city is made of food.

Like vegetables, desserts, dumplings etc etc

You fight other gangs, smuggle sugary treats and escape the police.

The campaign will be very violent and deadly

So make a spare char when you start

Society is organised with bland flavourless white food at the top and unhealthy disgusting foreign food at the bottom

The city elites are veggies and ham sandwiches and the poor people are immigrants

  

Unhealthy and foreign foods

Like fried chicken, calzones, ice cream, candybars, dumplings etc

Foreign foods are considered weird outsiders and unhealthy food are considered bad for society

  
Healthy food = rich white people

Unhealthy food = poor white people

Foreign food = italian, jamaican, chinese and other immigrants

  

Youre going to be playing as a criminal whos goal it is to conquer the city and make a name for their gang
