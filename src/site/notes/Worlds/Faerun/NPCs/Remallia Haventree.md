### Class

Lady **Remallia Haventree** was [[Waterdhavian\|Waterdhavian]] noblewoman and an agent of the [[Worlds/Faerun/Factions/Harpers\|Harpers]] during the late 15th century DR. She famously founded the Council of Waterdeep, a conciliary body that united the Five Factions of the Sword Coast against the emergent threat of the Cult of the Dragon during the 1480s DR. 

“
We have an evil wizard situation and Thay is involved. No surprises there.
”
— Lady Remallia, in reference to the Red Wizards.


## Description

Remallia had distinctly bronze-colored skin. Despite her elven heritage, she had aged considerably during a few short decades in her life.

She dressed in elegant finery that included beauteous robes and non-ostentatious jewelry.

## Personality

Lady Remallia was honest and friendly. She understood the threats that faced the Realms, but understood the caution of her fellow Harpers. She also agreed to compromise with lesser evils to fight more nefarious but not at all prices. The untimely death of her husband at the Dragon Cult's hand served only to increase Remallia's willingness to fight against the forces of evil.

Not one to open dialogue, Remi let others speak first before saying her piece.
## Possessions

Among her possessions was a large oil painting of her family, crated before her husband's death some time during the mid—to—late 15th century

She was rather fond of ticklemint tea, which she served in silver kettle with porcelain teacups.

## Abilities

She was at the very least proficient in divination magic.
## Relationships

Lady Remallia was married [[Worlds/Faerun/NPCs/Arthagast Ulbrinter\|Arthagast Ulbrinter]] of the noble Ulbrinter family. Together they had two children: Arthius, their son that lived in [[Worlds/Faerun/Locations/Silverymoon\|Silverymoon]] , and Serenore, their daughter that lived with her family on the of Alaron in the Moonshaes.

She notably worked with Zehira Deryan, a protector of storm giant queen Serissa.

## History

[![](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/forgottenrealms/images/7/74/Remi.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/300?cb=20220513154542)](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/forgottenrealms/images/7/74/Remi.png/revision/latest?cb=20220513154542)

Lady Haventree was a skilled spellcaster.

Remallia was a noble sun elf living in Waterdeep in Ulbrinter Villa, once the home of her husband Arthagast.

At some point she joined the Harpers.

### Tyranny of Dragons

During the 1480s DR, the Cult of the Dragon raided Ulbrinter Villa in search of a draconic artifact  "White Dragon Mask" stolen by a Zhentarim agent, and killed Lord Arthagast. Lady Remallia took decisive action in response, methodically and purposefully dismantling the cult's operations with all the resources at her disposal. She was the decisive force in uniting the Five Factions in the Council of Waterdeep, founded to combat the menace of the Cult of the Dragon. For her efforts she was chosen as the Harpers' representative on the Council. While Remallia was proactive in fighting the Cult, she had to exercise cautioned due to the Harpers' precarious position of having just been recently reformed. In the end, the Five Factions raised a massive army and defeated the cult's goddess Tiamat at her temple in the Well of Dragons.

### Against the Red Wizards

Lady Remallia then turned her attention towards the Cult of the Dragon's onetime allies, the Red Wizards of Thay. She worked with her fellow [[Worlds/Faerun/Factions/Harpers\|Harpers]] and a group of adventurers to investigate a Red Wizard safehouse in [[Worlds/Faerun/Locations/Waterdeep 1\|Waterdeep 1]]'s Dock Ward, then directed them to take information they recovered to [[Candlekeep\|Candlekeep]] for interpretation. A short time later, she was summoned to the [[Maelstrom\|Maelstrom]] by the storm giant queen Serissa.

Remallia's investigation led to the discovery of the Tenebrous Creed), a sect of Shar-worshipping cultists obsessed with the Far Realm, and the being known as Father Llymic. She worked with adventurers and [[Worlds/Faerun/Factions/Harpers\|Harpers]] in the Moonsea region to recover a living blade of disaster that was unearthed by the Red Wizards. Working with Zehira Deryan, Remallia directed the party to form a lookout post Abeiran necropolis of Xorvintroth deep underground in Icewind Dale and soon joined them in their efforts to [[Spy\|spy]] on the Red Wizards.

During her stay in the city, Remallia became afflicted with some unknown malady. She began to unknowingly harm herself, leaving wounds that created ichor-filled boils upon her skin. She began muttering to herself, about strange "slivers" that communicated with one another. Despite this, she still managed to work with her adventurer allies to free the slaves the Red Wizards had made captive in Xorvintroth, and uncover what they truly sought out: the Supreme Forge.

### Return to [[Worlds/Faerun/Locations/Waterdeep 1\|Waterdeep 1]]

In the Year of the Scarlet Witch, 1491 DR, the goddess [[Worlds/Faerun/NPCs/Eilistraee\|Eilistraee]] returned to the Realms near the walls of [[Worlds/Faerun/Locations/Waterdeep 1\|Waterdeep 1]]. In turn many of the goddess' [[Drow\|drow]] followers travelled to the City of Splendors _en masse_. Some of their numbers approached Remallia and requested aid in constructing a temple of [[Worlds/Faerun/NPCs/Eilistraee\|Eilistraee]] in the city. Lady Remallia agreed to provide her support to their cause._]
