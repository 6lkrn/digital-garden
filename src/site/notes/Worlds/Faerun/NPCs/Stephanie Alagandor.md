The Half-[[Elf\|Elf]] beloved of [[Worlds/Faerun/NPCs/Dagult Neverember\|Dagult Neverember]], and one of my PCs that I'm canonizing into this setting. In the two season [[Worlds/Faerun/Locations/Neverwinter\|Neverwinter]] campaign in 4th Edition Encounters, I played Stephanie as a [[Noble\|Noble]] who had the *real* Crown of [[Worlds/Faerun/Locations/Neverwinter\|Neverwinter]] and allied herself with Dagult, because she believed that he would be better for the country. She offered to be his partner, and--in this setting--he agreed; a relationship that proved romantic. Stephanie became Dagult's most trusted confidant and eventually beloved as her feminine touch softened Dagult's initial overbearing means, helping him become a better Lord Protector.

 

In this campaign setting, she is the Mayor of Neverwinter, a position she got when she discovered the source of Soman Galt's erratic behavior. In a public scene, as Stephanie confronted him about some recent decisions that could be described as "Soman is off his medication," (It concerned the eventual sealing of the Chasm District) Soman Galt went through a violent transformation into an Abolethic Monstrosity, attacking Neverember and his associates until Stephanie dispatched him with her bowmanship. Her heroism produced enough popular support to grant her Soman's vacated seat.

 

Stephanie is an Cleric of Sehanine Moonbow, who's followers can use the bow as both weapon and implement, in-setting, she used her connection with her bow to multiclass into Arcane Archery, the few instances of a Divine Class capable of doing so.

 

Her most notable aspect is her invention of a felt tip arrow. When fired from her bow, it hits for no damage; it's like being hit by a Nerf Dart, but it can still be imbued with an spell. Read: She can cast touch-ranged Healing Spells from 120 feet away, provided she hits DC 10 DEX check for willing allies.
