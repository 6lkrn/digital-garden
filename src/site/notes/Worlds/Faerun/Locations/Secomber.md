**Micro-Worldbuilding Opportunities:** If there’s any place that needs a willing party to rescue them, it’s Secomber (Honesty, from what I heard about in *Ed Greenwood presents Elminister’s Forgotten Realms*, I expected this place to fare better, but I digress). Expect a campaign to deal with whatever’s bothering them. The Cloud Giant encounter there is purely for lore gathering, and they didn’t hang around to find out what’s bothering the city…

…unless they did find out and decided to fund a party to deal with them.
