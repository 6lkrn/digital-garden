(Source: *Storm King’s Thunder*, Page 88)

Instead of the three Stone Giants (or maybe supplementing them) will be a creature from *Volo’s Guide to [[Monsters\|Monsters]]*: A Stone Giant Dreamwalker (*Volo’s Guide to [[Monsters\|Monsters]]* 149-150). I’m thinking that, after the events of *Storm King’s Thunder*, there would be a couple newer Dreamwalkers wandering around creation.
