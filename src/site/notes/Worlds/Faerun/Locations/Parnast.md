Parnast is where I begin splicing in Adventurer's League modules into the campaign setting. Up to *Storm King's Thunder*, the formerly called Expeditions series take place in the Moonsea region. Now they're spreading out across Faerun, including some within where I’m working in. Even after the events of *Storm King’s Thunder*, the shattering of the ordning will have effects for campaign seasons to come.

Here is the list of Adventurer’s League modules I’ll be incorporating here:

-   DDAL05-01 Treasure of the Broken Hoard

-   DDAL05-02 The [[Worlds/Faerun/Locations/Black Road\|Black Road]]

-   DDAL05-03 Uninvited Guests

-   DDAL05-10 Giant Diplomacy

-   DDAL05-12 Bad Business in Parnast

-   DDAL05-16 Parnast Under Siege
