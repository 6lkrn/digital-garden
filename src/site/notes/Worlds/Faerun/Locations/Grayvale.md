(Source: *Storm King’s Thunder, Pages 87-88)*

Honestly, between this and the next section, I wasn’t aware of what should be here. But then again, I made the mistake of putting *The Flying Misfortune* (Link: <http://www.dmsguild.com/product/199431/[[Worlds/Faerun/Locations/Amphail\|Amphail]]--a-Storm-Kings-Thunder-DMs-Resource>) here instead of further north near [[Worlds/Faerun/Locations/Deadsnows\|Deadsnows]], as the module suggested. I cry pardon, and rectify.

Silixia will still be here and she’ll still have a friendly face. She’ll state that even through the stone giants have been driven away some of them will still be around.
