(Source: *Princes of the Apocalypse*)

The dungeon under the Dessarin Hills that is the heart of the *Princes of the Apocalypse* campaign. This temple will be restyled for its customized history: The dungeon was originally a dwarven mine that taps into four elemental nodes in the deepest parts of the dungeons, designed to instill elemental energies into their craft. However, for everyone who creates or discovers a new form of energy for the betterment of society, there's another who would want to use it as a weapon. That's what the Elemental Cults come in. They wish to tap into these nodes of elemental energy to summon their four Elemental Princes to bring the material plane (Toril as a whole) to a primitive, "Natural" state. Read: Civilization is a virus on the planet, destroying the planet, and in order to save the planet they must destroy civilization. This will be the basis for the revised *Princes of the Apocalypse*.

You don’t even have to do the whole module. There is a chance that some campaigns nearby would want to go in there to fetch something, maybe to chase down some mid-carder feeb of pick up an artifact and weapon that’s stored there. It’s an excellent pre-made dungeon to work with on itself, and then there’s the Elemental Cults to work into.

(The Elemental Cults will only come into play during *Princes of the Apocalypse.*)

The Floors are in the same configuration and lettering in *Princes of the Apocalypse*, but the names of the floors are changed:
