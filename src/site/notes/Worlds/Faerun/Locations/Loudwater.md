**Micro-Worldbuilding Opportunities:** Loudwater has several campaign seeds to work on. From elves looking to reclaim the village ([[Worlds/Other worlds/NPCs/Eldreth Valuuthra\|Eldreth Valuuthra]]) to the staggering high taxes causing people to see a better home to any remaining giant (or dragon) incursion from the [[Graypeak Mountains\|Graypeak Mountains]]. The city is wide open for expansion. Add on top of that is that Loudwater will be the southern end of the [[Delimbiyr Road Expansion\|Delimbiyr Road Expansion]].

**[[Campaign Resources/Magic/Spells/Teleportation Circle\|Teleportation Circle]]:** I might have Revil be a more diligent manager of the Smiling Satyr, or just forget him and have Gharwin take over, she’s the one who knows aobut the circle anyway.
