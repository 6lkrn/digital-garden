**Micro-Worldbuilding Opportunities:** If you need a mine for resources or a Netherese crypt and not feeling like dealing with building a desert location, the Greypeak Mountains is a good place to put it. I've already done so once with my Thursday table and will probably do so with the Airship Adventure. Also, because it is close to [[Worlds/Faerun/Locations/Parnast\|Parnast]], expect to see some parts of the Adventurers League modules spill over to this region.
