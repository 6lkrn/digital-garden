**Micro-Worldbuilding Opportunities**: Just like with parts of [[Worlds/Faerun/Locations/Neverwinter\|Neverwinter]] proper, parts of [[Worlds/Faerun/Locations/Neverwinter\|Neverwinter]] Wood are quiet enough for someone to set up a farm or build a tower. Or even set up a ruin for someone to practice exploring.

Which got me thinking of something I’ve toyed with: A group making some trainer ruins for budding adventurers to learn the way and have a controlled adventure constructed to ensure that the party can learn from their mistakes and not die. Parts of the still-devastated [[Worlds/Faerun/Locations/Neverwinter\|Neverwinter]] Wood would be a perfect place for such a trainer camp.
