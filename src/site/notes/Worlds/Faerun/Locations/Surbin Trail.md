**Micro-Worldbuilding Opportunities:** The book says that it hugs the eastern shore of the Surbrin river while shying away from the [[Worlds/Faerun/Locations/Evermoors\|Evermoors]]. On the map, however, I notice that trail cutting straight though a piece of that swamp. I see this trail going through some low bridges made of stone going across the wetlands, people who traverse here keeping their heads on a swivel for badguys.
