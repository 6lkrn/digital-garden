(Source: *Storm King’s Thunder,* Pages 44-48, 86)

I see that place none the worse for wear after the Hill Giant insurgency during *Storm King’s Thunder*. The combination of Chauntea’s benevolence and the [[Worlds/Barovia/Factions/Emerald Enclave\|Emerald Enclave]]’s presence made sure of that.

The people at Goldenfields are rebuilding the city walls and its fortifications, and the year’s crops are planted. There might be an opportunity for another Hill Giant encounter, or other raid, but none as massive as in *Storm King’s Thunder*. You can also add minor quests to protect food shipments somewhere in here.
