**Micro-Worldbuilding Opportunities**: Dealing with the Orcs and the White Dragon and providing enough protection from the [[Worlds/Faerun/Locations/Evermoors\|Evermoors]] to rebuild Nesme will be a campaign in and of itself. Since the Storm King's Thunder's Encounter isn't suggested anymore, you can toss in any swamp-related encounter here.
