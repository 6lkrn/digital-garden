(Source: *Princes of the Apocalypse*, Pages 180-187)

*Princes of the Apocalypse* has with them some side quests, including a small introductory adventure that leads up into the module proper. Some of these quests probably weren't even touched by players, so I’ll include them here.

This mini-adventure would be perfect for any campaign, especially if Orcs are involved. If the party feels the need for something like the Orcsplitter, just have Gargosh show up and plop in the whole adventure with little adjustments. (Probably some encounter adjustments for the PC’s levels, but otherwise it can be run as written.)
