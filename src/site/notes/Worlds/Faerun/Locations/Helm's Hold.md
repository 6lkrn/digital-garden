At first I wanted to dig into the 4E *[[Worlds/Faerun/Locations/Neverwinter\|Neverwinter]] Campaign Setting* Until I found out in the *Sword Coast Adventurer’s Guide* that things are looking up for [[Worlds/Faerun/Locations/Neverwinter\|Neverwinter]], but this entrant here has its own fruits to pick from. Provided that I don’t give in to the desire to nuke Helm’s Hold from orbit.

[[Worlds/Faerun/Factions/The Order of the Gilded Eye\|The Order of the Gilded Eye]]is going to be trouble. Anything taken to Extremism will be. It would not be *if* the party gets in trouble with them if they’re in Helm’s Hold, but *when*.

In the end, I see [[Dark Lord\|Dark Lord]] in Holy Watcher Qerria’s future. She’s *that* kind of Evil.

Also, the ghosts. Most them could be Spellplague victims, but a rising number of them will be victims of the Guilded Eye. It might take someone who can speak with these spirits to find out the truth. For Players with forethought in their character creation, this shouldn’t be a problem.

The Order of the Guilded Eye will go into hyperbolic revenge if the party wrongs them even the slightest. Or go against the [[Worlds/Faerun/Factions/Order of the Gauntlet\|Order of the Gauntlet]] and create a Faerun-wide turf war, with everyone including PC characters caught in the middle. Or the ultimate, Qerria reveals herself as the Succubus Rohini, the “Prophet” of the Ashmadai. Lawful Evil Knights Templar activity might be right up Rohini’s alley.
