(Source: *Storm King's Thunder*, Chapter 8)

Even without the *Storm King’s Thunder* storyline, the Yakfolk village might be of some interest, especially when the players are pressed to deal with the Yakfolk as well.

With my revisions, [[Worlds/Faerun/Factions/House Xorlarrin\|House Xorlarrin]] will move into Ironslag once the Fire Giants were driven away. The few remaining Fire Giants become enslaved by [[Worlds/Faerun/Factions/House Xorlarrin\|House Xorlarrin]] by its Matron Mother.

Which gets me thinking of [[Illithoids\|Illithoids]].

I'm thinking that, [[Worlds/Faerun/Factions/House Xorlarrin\|House Xorlarrin]] might have an expert enchantment and enslavement abilities to get the Fire Giants around their fingers, or they might have Mind Flayers in their house, or they might have an [[Illithoid\|Illithoid]]. I don't know yet.

I do know that I'll be reworking Ironslag for this purpose.
