(Source: *Hoard of the Dragon Queen*, Chapter 6)

One of my players, who ran a [[Tiefling\|tiefling]] warlock with a personality like Morrigan from *Darkstarkers*, died while I was running *Hoard of the Dragon Queen*. May he be more dangerous now that heâ€™s dead.

Out of Respect, I have his character, Tasha by name, take over [[Castle Naerytar\|Castle Naerytar]] and rebuild into a place of research. (and pleasure; Tasha is [[[../../../Creatures/NPCs/Non Player Characters/Pencheska\|Pencheska]]'s Warlock, after all.) Any party is invited to come to this Castle and research its expansive library (those who know of this would say that the only place with more books is [[Candlekeep\|Candlekeep]], and Tasha doesn't require a book she doesn't have yet as an entry fee.) There will be researchers who will be using the observatory, as well as compiling notes on the Black Dragon(s) nearby.

This will of course mean that the remix of this castle will be listed in a later Issue, since the castle will be rebuilt, so will the map.
