Meldav Kanifi![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/t-E_x-RifV3hhQOVvxHyHBVo2bjjfn_Ful3InAA7IiXa5MX3DmVavmDjYyUTfqTsp6VKuODX8UpxOlbLfNTmwEosG2mnvw2NTevMisoUn4vTsKcQazgLqYTI_cBOvSGw3_eWU7p4z7ALJcRr6fI76Q)

Once upon a time in a parallel plane far, far away, there was a female goblin named Meldav Kanifi. White long hair, light green skin, 3’8 tall and 69 pounds, Meldav was such a lovely goblin who was so kind-hearted and gracious, yet it was her personality that her green-skinned kin regarded her as some kind of oddity, a misfit, and even her parents felt dishonored for having such a peculiar child - a freak among freaks.

Fairy white hair and tender skin tainted by her own blood, she was often bullied by the goblins of her tribe joined by her siblings, for being too innocent, but she still put a bright smile on her bruised face after being beaten up everytime. While the other young goblins slaughtered rodents and feasted on flesh blood for fun, Meldav grieved for the dying mammals because they were her only friends beneath the surface.

She was eventually exiled from the underground by the tribe onto the menacing surface of Feywoods when she was pretty much still a young teen, being forced to survive on her own in the awe-inspiring wild of Fey beasts and creatures, but she wasn’t really the type to be easily discouraged, as proven by her childhood life back in the underground cavern.

Meldav first gathered what she believed to be edible from the Feywild, berries, mushrooms, herbs, everything carefully held in her tiny arms before she found a hollowed tree trunk large enough to comfortably settle a lone goblin. She tasted everything she discovered, only to realize that she started having hallucinations, twisted visions, dancing fungi, singing trees with faces, before she was severely poisoned and fainted. The next time she opened her eyes, she saw a white raven, its feathers shared the same color as her hair, its head twisting from side to side expressing curiosity towards the waking girl, but flew away as soon as Meldav sat up, surprised that she was still alive.

Through careful study, the goblin girl figured out what could be consumed and what could not, and this study further expanded to other fields related to the Feywild, from its natural resources to flora to fauna, as she explored the wild without disturbing its nature, all under the watch of the white raven unbeknown to her. It almost seemed that the Feywild also respected the goblin for her passion for the woods. She learned to communicate with Fey creatures as years passed and slowly, be fully accepted by the Feywild. The once empty tree trunk was now completely furnished with many great things - a table handcrafted for crafting and study, a bookshelf full of books written by the tree trunk owner herself, a good number of druidic items, preserved skulls of various species, and more. It even had a proper door now!

The white raven was now a really close companion to Meldav, almost seen lingering around her the entire time. Everything appeared to be peaceful to the goblin girl, living in serenity with her Fey neighbors as she casually wrote her research on her table. All of a sudden, her mind went total blank, void, black, and she woke up in what looked to be a basement of a dungeon, without her past memories. It felt like she still remembered everything a second ago, and now it was all gone. She felt frustrated, helpless, yet she could not do anything about it but to scan through the basement, and this was when she met the other adventurers, suffering from amnesia just like her. Why was she here, what was the purpose of the goblin girl among the rest? Nobody knows, or perhaps, somebody knows.
