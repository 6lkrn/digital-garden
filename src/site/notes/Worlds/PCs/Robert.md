### **Yoink!** 

Can take anything from anyone (equipment, food, objects) from a long distance, as long as Robert himself can carry said object (so no objects that are too large or too heavy).

**Weakness**

Objects taken are not necessarily done by stealth; the owner of said object will realise when their object is taken. Robert can only take material objects. Robert cannot take an object that he is unable to carry at the time, even if he can carry the object at any other times (e.g. inventory, hands, and pockets are all full, so cannot take an apple)
