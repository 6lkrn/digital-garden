[[Campaigns/Players/Marvis\|Marvis]] - Smuggled as a child, passed around and eventually sold to the Chambers of the Mistress. Became a cleric for the Mistress (Loviatar).
One day, the Chambers was attacked and I found my chance to escape and start a new. With skills taught to me, I am able to twiddle men around my pinky (teachings of Loviatar).
Hatred for [[human\|human]] trafficker. Looking for the lowlife group that stole her as a child from her home. Looking to find her family and origin. Join bounty hunter groups occasionally hoping to find clues of her past.
