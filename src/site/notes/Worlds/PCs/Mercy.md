## BackstoryÂ 

1 Mercutio Macness the youngest child of the Macness family. A mercantile family that deals in the export of medicines across the seas. Started out from enterprising doctors, they were at the forefront body when it comes to pharmaceutical supplies for hospitals. Whether in the bustling cities or the secluded hamlet.  
  

2 Throughout their childhood, they were commonly seen in the hospital of the mainland. Parents were both physicians and barely had time to look after them at home. So they brought Mercutio with them when it comes to work. The smells of medicine, antiseptics and herbs were part of the norm.

  

3Â  Normal schooling was something hard to come by with the profession of their parents. So it was assigned to private tutors. Where Mercutio learnt both accounting and medicines. While their likelihood to inherit most of the family business was little to none, it was expected of them to at least be proficient in the fields. So they can make a life for themselves at least.

  

4 Throughout their childhood, Mercutio heard stories about the lands beyond. Where healthcare were rather scarce. So against the family will of them being a physician working in their own hospital, Mercutio decided to go out there and help where they can.

5 They had to move a lot when they were little. So a thing like soft beds and warm blankets were rather hard to come by, what was a constant were the smell of antiseptics in the air. The thought of such a liquid capable of clearing festering wounds sounds almost poetic.

  

6 Everyone has a right to healthcare but not to the point of abuse. There were ethics to be followed. The idea of doctors abusing certain medicines is downright anathema to Mercutio. Those highs are best used for patients that are in pain. Not chasing some ethereal rabbits and talking to the moon. SmhÂ 

  

7 Abusing drugs for the most part. Mercutio would be absolutely livid knowing certain people would peddle around narcotics. Making addicts and escaping the hardship of daily life.

  

8 In the world of science, there is a place for religion. Why some of the premier scientists and surgeons were rather pious people! There are things that canâ€™t be explained. Seen as miracles. While some people would chalk it up to some yet unexplained events, Mercutio has a belief in a higher power. They didnâ€™t know what just yet. As the family they were in were not really a religion leaning type. Though the cycle of Life and Death is not something they would deny.

  

9 Children should not be harmed in any shape or form. If there is no god out there, they would be the one to bring down judgment.

10 Mercutioâ€™s hobby is both writing and reading. None of that scientific stuff, they liked to lose themselves in a good fantasy book.

  

11 Collecting buttons. Mercutio took it up from one of their tutors who has a significant number of them. The stories about them!

  

12 Hard drugs. Mercutioâ€™s has been around addicts to last a lifetime. So any partaking would make Mercutio leave the room.

  

13 The family members, tutors and patients from the hospitals for the most part. Their parents even though busy with work always made time for Mercutio. The tutors were always supportive and the patients always entertaining them with stories of their lives.

  

14 Thereâ€™s always bad sorts in the mercantile field. With them peddling medicines, people would tinker with the dosages to either increase or lessen the effect. People that abuse that would never have a seat at Mercutioâ€™s table.

  

15 People afflicted from rabies. They function like rabid animals with mouth frothing and wanting to bite around and spread the disease. *shudders*

  

16 An apprentice to their mentor.Â 

  

17 A student that want to surpass their tutors. They donâ€™t have much to learn except for practicalsÂ 

18 (~not telling~ ðŸ˜›)

  

19 Lean built elf. Pointy ears studded with piercings. Pale blonde hair with blue streaks.Â  Wearing a simple shirt with pants along with scrubs on showing that Mercutioâ€™s a doctor!

  

20 Running away for the most part. Trying to not be in the thick of things.

  

21 People are generally neutral, there are so many factors that would change a person. Godâ€™s perception are not to be questioned for it is pointless. Mortals are meant to stay in their lane. Hotdogsâ€¦ sandwichesâ€¦ wat?

22 Physician in the ship for the most part. Tracking the food intake and nutritional values. Keeping patient data on their general health.

  

23 same as above

24 Honest work is hard to come by at this time. So to have an employer in whatever this is they were embarking on is a good start. Plying their trade in the ship would help Mercutio and the ship along with their goals for the long run.

  

25 Turquoise, like the color of planktons in the dark sea water when agitated. The stars beneath the waves.Â

Extra Details:Mercutio looks rather lethargic regardless of how many time they rest and recuperate. When looked closely it seems that they were listless. Still, when asked they would still be coherent. They have their own theories on why that is. Still they are coherent and functioningâ€¦ for the most part.
