[Zen](Zen.md)'s Character for [[12. Curse of Strahd 1\|12. Curse of Strahd 1]]

## Backstory

Raleigh was once a great and powerful gladiator, a reigning champion if you will. Any prospective challenger quakes at the mention of his name, the sound of his footsteps will make anyone cower in fear. His face is always twisted in a snarl, not one person in the arena had ever heard his voice, only his growls.

In truth, Raleigh is a very shy and anxious Leonin. He entered the arena by accident and also to run away from the noble that was trying to kill him, sure he said it all in jest but Lord Embers had no chill and was slighted. All he said was that the "Lady" Lord Embers married were known in some social circles to be rather promiscuous. He got some laughs at the bar from that but he didn't expect that the man himself would be there to hear it. 

Thus began the chase, Raleigh or should we say RawrXD at the time; ran away from the confrontations with Lord Embers men and assassins, until he stumbled to the Arena and unknowingly became a challenger for at the time current champion. Unexpectedly, against all odds, he won his first ever gladiatorial event. He kept on winning either by accident or sheer dumb luck. However, every dog (lion) has its days; his past caught up to him in the form of a rather sleek and elegant Tabaxi, Desire. 

Desire was his downfall. Although, that fact was unknown to him at the time. He cavorted with her and does his best to woo her so much that he gets arrogant and more brash than before. Although the other gladiators were afraid of him, now he was just a sore to the eyes. One fateful night, Desire sends a note to him that says “Come to the victor’s balcony, I am waiting”. He went in hopes that Desire had accepted his multiple proposals. However, what met him there was the sight of Lord Embers and his beady dark eyes. As Raleigh tried to escape, his exit was blocked by Desire and said the words that still rang in his mind nowadays “Bye Bye Little Kitty~ Sorry to break your heart, this is just business.” and then he fell, a rapier coated in something stabbed straight through his belly. Last bit of memory before he wakes again was the face of Desire and Lord Embers looking down on him.  

As was his battles, he survived through sheer dumb luck. However, he did wake up in a rather unsightly graveyard. Almost gave the groundskeeper a heart attack when he awakened. He stumbled to the city in tattered rags, and went back straight to the Arena, where he discovered it had been torn down and closed. Without any money to his name and a hungry belly, he does what desperate people do. He became an adventurer, it was rough at first when he only had the basic adventuring gear but after several dungeon delves and missions it became a bit easier, he bought several items/weapons to help him adventure better. He also found some people that looked like they knew what they are doing and he is currently adventuring with them. 

He was used to doing everything alone, and the first two months he was unsure what to do in a party. Things became better and the gears of the party started to click together when he almost got killed (again) and was saved by the Paladin; Mayari. He is indebted to Mayari and will do things Mayari said (to a certain extent). It has been 6 months since he joined the party, and it seems that an invitation was given to the party sometime during their bar hopping. 

  

## Notes

How he got his magical rage:   

When he first started his adventure, he met a druid that brought him to the Feywilde. That is as much as he remembered, he stepped into a portal and he stepped out of it. The druid's name was Aslan De La Vega, a female(?)male(?) Satyr.
