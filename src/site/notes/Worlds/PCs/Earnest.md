[[Campaigns/Players/Balky\|Balky]]'s char for [[Campaigns/As Player/9. Pirates - Chao/9. Pirates - Chao\|9. Pirates - Chao]]

A warforged that became the right hand man of the orc warlord that found him, comatose in an ancient dungeon. Earnest proved to be a capable and willing servant, he completed every task given to him. He was trained as an assassin. After he successfully killed an enemy lord, he was “knighted” in the fashion of the orcs, given his own small warband, servants, a title and land. 

Eventually the lord grew distrustful of him and began to plot against Earnest. Too fearful of a rebellion, the Orc warlord decided the simplest way would be to banish him on some foolhardy quest. So he sent him and 3 of his loyal retainers off to capture the “Mermaid’s Tear”. A magical item spoken only of in ancient myths. The warlord was confident in the fact that Earnest would never complete his mission. Earnest on the other hand planned to create a force strong enough to return as the conqueror.**
