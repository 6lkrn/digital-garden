[[Campaigns/Players/Petai\|Petai]]'s Character for [[Campaigns/As DM/6. Depths of Villainy/6. Depths of Villainy\|6. Depths of Villainy]]

## Petai’s character: Aera Aarochedes (or Aarococaine idk)

Backstory: 

The cries of the seagulls were ringing and the tides were pulling in like a soothing rhythm that could easily put a reader to sleep. The lighthouse guard glanced down to the shore and saw a five feet tall figure standing there, with a small bottle of rum in his hand gazed at the view for quite a while before taking a long sip. It was a very calming golden hour with clear skies and no sign of a storm coming. 

Nothing to be alarmed of, for he has known the figure for many years. In fact, he has pretty much watched over him ever since he was a young aarakocra. He had no friends and would spend long hours by the beach. Sometimes he just played with the sand, played with some crabs and giggled. The lighthouse guard panicked at first when the young aarakocra went missing, but he merely went for a swim. His fascination of the sea grew and started fishing and even attempted skin diving, and his catches were amazing every time. The aarakocra would give him some of the harvest and bring the rest home. They eventually became friends and bonded over stories about the seas and their lives. He told him everything he knew about the seas. The tales, the legends, survival stories, tips and hacks and everything in between.

When he asked the aarakocra why he's fascinated by the sea, he said exactly this:

"It's dangerous but it's calm

There's beauty within the rigorous waves

From the sky it's just a plain blue body of water with shimmery glows

But when you dive deep in it there's an abundance of life everywhere

People are scared of the seas because it can be unforgiving and ruthless

But oh man if I could befriend the sea imagine how liberating it will be"

  
He was moved by the words. It's unusual to see an aarakocra to be so interested in the seas, but the view of him standing in front of the ship made so much sense.

  

"Today must be the day, huh" 

  

For the past couple of years, the lighthouse guard watched him build a large vessel from scratch. His carpentry skill was halfway decent but spent quite an amount of time practising to perfect his skills. He said that he wants to build a ship and sail across the seas until the dawn of time! When he wasn't building the vessel, he would take a smaller and older ship for a cruise around the island scavenging for parts and materials. Recent months, he had been gone for days and even weeks but he managed to return well and alive and would share his encounters at the other islands. Heck, he even brought home a pet falcon! He said he named it [[Worlds/Other worlds/NPCs/Mr Furdur\|Mr Furdur]]. What a silly name. 

  

The lighthouse guard was surprised at first, that an aarakocra would be this proficient at maneuvering a ship but he has faith in him. After all, if he doesn't have faith in him who would? He didn't have friends and his family couldn't care less about him. 

  

He remembered that the aarakocra once ran away from home because his mom threw his collections of seashells away and came here to this very beach to seek solace. He was only happy here, not anywhere else. He didn't speak much about his family, only the fact that his parents gave up on him and just let him do whatever he wanted.

  

The lighthouse guard slowly made his way to the aarakocra's side. 

  

"Is everything ready, Aera?" 

  

Silence. 

  

"I'd miss you." 

  

Aera turned to the lighthouse guard and said "thank you for everything. I wouldn't have made it this far without you. You're my only friend and I would hate to leave you, but I really really want to sail the seas and see what is more out there" 

  

"I understand" 

  

"I can't wait to meet new people and experience new things. I have prepared a fresh batch of empty notebooks to keep all of my logs and findings. And when I return, I will, I promise, I will show you everything that I've got" 

  

"I'd probably kick the bucket before you even come back" 

  

They looked at each other and burst out laughing. 

  

"Y'know if I don't last out there, I just want to let you know that I'd die happy" 

  

It was a long silence before they exchanged a hug. 

  

"I'm gonna miss you"

"Likewise" 

  

"Want some rum?" 

  

"Don't mind if I do." Aera passed him the bottle of rum and he took a sip. 

  

"I know I have said this a hundred times before but I just wanna say it again. All my life, I have always felt like I don't belong in my own community. Being at the sea is where I felt belonged and exploring has been my passion. All I really want is friends to share that passion with. That's why I need to do this. Get out there on this ship and explore." 

  

Aera took the bottle from the lighthouse guard and took a sip. 

  

"Don't get me wrong. I'm also scared. That I'd die alone. I know I said I will die happy but if you really think about it, it's a pretty terrifying scene to die alone out there in the sea. Maybe [[Worlds/Other worlds/NPCs/Mr Furdur\|Mr Furdur]] will still be alive and eat my corpse. I can only die happy if I can fill all my notebooks with findings. That is, if I'm being honest." 

  

... 

  

With the final touches to set the ship on sail, Aera leap on the ship. He didn't really want to look back or he's going to cry. He made this decision a very long time ago. He's not turning back.

  

The lighthouse guard called out to him from the shore and yelled "And bring home a girl!!" 

  

[[Worlds/Other worlds/NPCs/Mr Furdur\|Mr Furdur]] squawked loudly in response.

  

…

  

First mission of the sail: rescue a halfling

  

A few months ago on Aera's trip he met a halfling by the name [[Worlds/Caermor/NPCs/Altzhen\|Altzhen]] at the Island of Blue Spirit. The island is known for its culinary street where a whole street was lined with restaurants of different cuisine run by people of different races. Like his previous trips he would go to the trading port and the beachtown for sightseeing before scavenging for raw materials and parts, and perhaps stop by the Fey’s Basil for a bullywug legs with white wine sauce before leaving.. 

  

Aera first met [[Worlds/Caermor/NPCs/Altzhen\|Altzhen]] when he was stopping by a tent to look at their magical goods. Poor halfling was shivering in his tattered clothes and was sitting by the street. He has only 3 fingers in each hand and he has burn scars all over his arms. Curious, he walked over to the halfling and gave him a piece of gold.

  

[[Worlds/Caermor/NPCs/Altzhen\|Altzhen]]’s eyes lit up. The gold piece could get him provision for a whole week! He bowed to Aera and thanked him profusely before sobbing.

  

“Hey hey you okay there?”

  

No one really asked [[Worlds/Caermor/NPCs/Altzhen\|Altzhen]] how he was before. He whispered softly “you’re the first who has shown me kindness”

  

“You wanna talk about it?”

  

“Is that okay?”

  

“Yeah. Let’s take a walk”

  

They both walked to the beach as they chatted. Aera learned that [[Worlds/Caermor/NPCs/Altzhen\|Altzhen]] was an orphan and used to work as a chef apprentice in the culinary street before the restaurant he worked at was burned down to ashes. Unfortunately the owner could no longer open a new one as his funds were running low due to his excessive gambling. No other restaurants wanted to hire him as an apprentice either because of his cleft hands and unsightly burn scars.

  

“What do you think of the sea?”

  

“I think it’s terrifying.”  
  

“Why is that?”

  

“I don’t know. I have never been to the sea before. I have a feeling that if I try to go beyond the shore I will be swept away. Like my life I have been swept off from my family and career.”

  

“Y’know, the sea is my life and exploring is my passion. If you want to, you can come with me to the sea and we can explore the world together. I can provide you shelter and clothes. You don’t have to suffer anymore. And most importantly you will never be alone”

  

[[Worlds/Caermor/NPCs/Altzhen\|Altzhen]] stared at the aarakocra for a full minute. He didn’t really know what to say.

  

“Anyways I will let you think about it. I will come back here in a few months and I hope that you will be ready to leave the island here then. Wait for me here at the beach and I will come for you”

  

…

  

There [[Worlds/Caermor/NPCs/Altzhen\|Altzhen]] was, at the beach. Aera couldn’t be any more happier that he now has a friend to sail with. He threw a rope over the something for the halfling to climb on “Welcome overboard, [[Worlds/Caermor/NPCs/Altzhen\|Altzhen]]!” The halfling got on board and they shared a hug together. 

  

“Thank you, Aera”

...

  

It has been almost 2 weeks out at sea. It rained for a couple of days before and though it was tough, Aera managed to steer through the storm. Good news is he has collected enough rainwater to last them for a week. Aera had tried to ration his supplies between him and [[Worlds/Caermor/NPCs/Altzhen\|Altzhen]] and only ate grains for breakfast and fish for dinner. They didn't really have to worry about their dinner though. Aera would go skin diving with his spear every 3 days and catch whatever fish he managed to find. [[Worlds/Caermor/NPCs/Altzhen\|Altzhen]] would gut the fish, grill one to eat and dry the rest. He had thought of simmering a triggerfish but it was too much of a treat.

  

They bonded really well together and learned a lot from each other. [[Worlds/Other worlds/NPCs/Mr Furdur\|Mr Furdur]] was cold towards [[Worlds/Caermor/NPCs/Altzhen\|Altzhen]] for a while at first but he was soon bought over with fantastic fish dishes that [[Worlds/Caermor/NPCs/Altzhen\|Altzhen]] made. The three of them felt safe with each other and the best takeaway from the sail so far was that they found family in each other. Something they never had.

  

Life is pretty good and Aera predicted that they will reach the next destination in less than 48 hours. But little did they know that their lives would take a turn with a fateful encounter… A friend? A foe? Who knows? For now, they rest on the deck under the stars and slowly drift into a deep sleep.
