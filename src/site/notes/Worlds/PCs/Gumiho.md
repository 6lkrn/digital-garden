[[Campaigns/Players/Crys\|Crys]]'s Char for [[Campaigns/As Player/8. Mafia - Tauhu/8. Mafia - Tauhu\|8. Mafia - Tauhu]]

## Gumiho

Kitsune Femme Fatale

### Backstory

- Gumiho was isekai’d into this world as a young kit. Unfortunately, he had the fortune to be sent to one of the still-warring regions. He would have perished were it not for the kindness of a wandering swordsman, a certain Blitz Rayne, who took him in as his own.
    
- He’s not the only poor soul, it seems: Blitz was already touting around—literally, as he had to be kept in what is essentially a movable basin—another kid, a shark-selkie by the name Nova Ampora.
    
- The trio lived a nomadic life, moving around from desolate wasteland to another, trying to outrun all the death and misery. Though they didn’t have much, Blitz made sure they never truly wanted for anything— there’s always some kind of roof over their head, some kind of food on the table, some kind of toys to play with. Not the best, but certainly not the worst.
    
- A world ravaged by bloodshed is no place for a child. Yet still does a child live. Though it pains him to do so, he taught the kids as much combat knowledge as he could. As they grew older, he even gave them the decision to “specialise”— Gumiho went for knives, swords, and blades of all kinds; Nova chose staves.
    
- All things come to an end. Their travels took them far and wide, until they happened upon [GENERIC CITY]. Blitz tires of all the camping and moving, and so secured a place for them to stay in there. Though the kids’ routine didn’t change much, their brother goes out more often, running around doing…… errands, or something. They aren’t privy to the details.
    
- Seasons change. Kids grow. Blitz’s beloved little brothers aren’t so little anymore. They decided that they needed to pull their own weight! Or whatever that [[human\|human]] expression is. Unfortunately, there’s not a lot of jobs that a skill set of “fight very well” and “run very fast” (and “fishes very fishily” and “foxes very foxily”) can bag. Fortunately, this is the apocalypse: there is definitely someone somewhere wanting to kill someone else somewhere else.
    
- Enter, left stage: the mafia. The easiest way to get paid to kill someone. The duo joins up with the local familia— Gumiho as a rogue of sorts, Nova as a hired muscle.
    

Notes:

- As of right now, the kids are both 59 years of age— they were isekai’d at the tender age of 45.
    
- No one is sure how old Blitz is, but he looks middle-aged.
    

### The Trio

#### [[Campaigns/Players/Crys\|Crys]] Captor

Gumiho is not this vixen’s true name: his real name is [[Campaigns/Players/Crys\|Crys]] Captor.

  

[[Campaigns/Players/Crys\|Crys]] is…… something. His people did not have a name for themselves, at least as far as he’s aware. They are a race of fox-like people who possess shapeshifting capabilities and control over magic, defined by their multiple tails. Most fox-people that one encounters would be of the three- to six-tailed variants. Those with less are younger, and typically do not stray from their own; those with more are ancient, powerful, and, most importantly, dangerous— a meeting with one almost certainly spells doom. 

  

One could say they are divided between two variants—the more benevolent tricksters, and the more malevolent man-eaters—though one would not be able to tell which kind a fox-person is at first glance: it is their behaviour that separates them, after all, not their appearance. As such, the fox-people weren’t very welcome in their homeworld, and much less can be said about their receptance here.

  

A fox-person goes through the early moments of their life as a kit. In this stage, they possess no powers whatsoever. Unless one happens to possess a particularly vibrant and/or unnatural colouring, it is virtually impossible to distinguish them from a typical fox kit. As they near maturity, their shapeshifting capabilities start emerging, though they have no control over it, causing one to shift—and shift weirdly—until they finally mature at fifty years of age. It is also at this stage that a fox-person usually receives their second tail. Usually. The mechanics in which their tails multiply are a mystery even to them: some obtain them through an intense search for enlightenment, others get their tails as an achievement for outstanding deeds, and yet others get them just for passing age milestones. What is certain is that the more tails a fox-person has, the greater their magical prowess is.

  

Fox-people are all naturally capable of baser forms of magic—like conjuring and bending the elements to their will. Fire appears to be the favoured element of the foxkin, so much so that they’ve even adapted it to themselves, creating foxfire: a fire that does not do harm physically, but inflicts mental effects onto the receiver. The effects appear to be controllable by the conjurer. That said, sorceries that are unique to the fox-people deal with the art of illusions, stealth, and dreams; these magics require more training to be utilised effectively. All of this makes them popular familiars, but taming a fox-person to be obedient to one is no easy task, and the summoning and binding ritual get harder and riskier depending on the tail amount the summoner desires.

  

Funnily enough, Nova had a similar race in his homeworld. They were called many names: fox spirits, fox demons, kitsunes, kumihos. Some even had different names for “fully enlightened” fox-people—jiuweihu and kyubi—though Nova tells him it just means “nine-tailed fox”, which isn’t all that cool. Still, a name! [[Campaigns/Players/Crys\|Crys]] is glad to even just have a name to call himself. Nova’s people used the first two, and that is what [[Campaigns/Players/Crys\|Crys]] has taken to calling his race. He was enamoured with the name kumiho, and modified that into his alias: Gumiho.

##### Example of Magic the Foxkin Could Use

- Any School of Illusion spell.
    
- Spells that apply the Charmed status effect.
    
- Spells with the Deception tag.
    
- Spells that require a WIS save.
    
- Cantrips and 1st level spells that deal Elemental damage.
    
- A special kind of fire known as foxfire, which either deals Psychic damage or applies a mental status effect of the conjurer’s choosing.
    

##### Example of Magic [[Campaigns/Players/Crys\|Crys]] Could Do

- Foxfire
    
- Minor elemental magic (e.g. small flame conjuration, manipulation of a small amount of water, etc.)
    
- [[Campaign Resources/Magic/Spells/Invisibility\|Campaign Resources/Magic/Spells/Invisibility]]
    
- [[Campaign Resources/Magic/Spells/Minor Illusion\|Campaign Resources/Magic/Spells/Minor Illusion]]
    
- [[Campaign Resources/Magic/Spells/Blur\|Campaign Resources/Magic/Spells/Blur]]
    
- Phantasmal Force
    
- Suggestion
    
- Vicious Mockery
    

  

Notes:

- Magic that is neither foxfire nor minor elemental magics is something that has to be practised and perfected. [[Campaigns/Players/Crys\|Crys]] would experience difficulty in using them.
    
- The more tails a fox-person has, the higher level the spells they can do. Since [[Campaigns/Players/Crys\|Crys]] currently has two tails, he can only do magic that is equivalent to 2nd level spells or lower.
    

#### Nova Ampora

Nova is best described as a shark selkie— a siorsie, as [[Campaigns/Players/Crys\|Crys]] has taken to affectionately calling him. He possesses a sharkskin pelt that he can don and doff, allowing him to go over- and underwater as he pleases.

  

Siorsies have three forms they can take: a full [[human\|human]] form; a partial, mershark form; and of course, a full shark form. The [[human\|human]] half of the partial form has fins for ears and on the forearm, but it isn’t like the full [[human\|human]] form is any better— though lacking in fin-ery, their ashen skin, dark beady eyes, and sharp teeth all still make them impossible to mistake as [[human\|human]]. Not that Nova cares: if anyone has a problem with that, they can take it up with his fists.

  

Similar to the kitsunes, siorsies also take fifty years to fully mature, spending that time as a shark pup, unable to doff their skin. Nearing that mark, they’re able to take it off partially, unlocking the mershark form. However, unlike the foxkin, siorsies have no natural magical affinity, but their fantastical nature does allow them to master it fairly easily compared to, say, humans.

  

A desire to at least be near a body of water, combined with their unpopularity as familiars, makes siorsies a rare sight on land. Even in coastal areas, these shark-selkies prefer to keep to themselves in the depths of the ocean.

  

Nova stands well above Gumiho, at 189cm tall. He’s commonly seen mullering about in a violet (blood-stained) 飞鱼服— a garment whose name ironically translates to “flying fish outfit”. One might be wise to think twice before making any such jokes at his expense, however; his fuse is short and his staff’s range long. Sharks do not have great eyesight, and this rings true even for the sharkman: a pair of glasses sits on his face, its plastic body painted gold.

#### Blitz Rayne

Though he’s more of a father to the duo, he insists they see him as a brother instead. They don’t question it.

  

There’s not much to be said about their lovely older brother here. He’s really nice. He may or may not have participated in the war. His hair is weird. He’s gay. He always has a necklace strung around his neck. His skin is really dark. He has a big ass sword. There’s a scar over his left eye. He says he’s “German”, whatever that means. He has a pair of wings tattooed on his back. He doesn’t like it when people call him by his first name. What else is there to say about him?

  

He appears [[human\|human]], though rumours abound that he isn’t. After all, what kind of self-respecting man would take it upon himself to raise a bunch of freaks in a world they didn’t belong to? No one, that’s who. Yes, surely no being in this world would be so self-sacrificing as to undertake such a burdenful task. Nay, that man must be not [[human\|human]]; must be a really freaky angel or something.
