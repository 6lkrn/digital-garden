[[Campaigns/Players/Ben\|Ben]]'s Character for [[_Ongoing Campaign/26. Curse of Strahd 2/26. Curse of Strahd 2\|26. Curse of Strahd 2]]

**Childhood**

**M**organ was born in a ghost town located northwest of Raven Woods. There is nothing worth noting about this young man as there is no legacy or bloodline he is born into. Young Morgan is just a bastard unwanted by his parents due to their negligence in wearing protection nine months ago. He was out in the streets in no time as a young kid trying to fend for himself. This led to Morgan having to quickly learn the ways of the world as a young lad. Growing up was not easy for Morgan because, in a ghost town where criminals and outlaws are rampant, things aren’t exactly sunshine and rainbows. There were no nice neighbours, no bakeries, no mayor, no authorities, no smiles, and no compassion.  Crimes were common and it was always kill or be killed. In the gloomy town, Morgan would watch as shady men wandered around town, dealing with arms and robbing innocent passersby for money. The bandits laugh with joy as they distribute their loot amongst themselves and proceed to waste it on food, booze and women. This was integrated into young Morgan’s mind where one can be truly happy when one obtains tons of loot and gold you can do anything you can possibly want. It felt exhilarating for young Morgan to watch how easy it was to obtain gold by just possessing a weapon in hand. From then on, it was just a matter of when and how he would obtain a weapon of his own to start his journey to becoming rich so that he could do everything he wanted and have everything he wanted. Young Morgan would attempt to rob passersby in the woods at nightfall on his own but without experience and weapons, he would be beaten up by the passersby instead.

**Mentor**

To Morgan’s luck, the passerby whose name would be Zark is actually an infamous Tinkerer who was on the run from the authorities after a heist gone wrong in the West. Zark is a man with a large frame, with a height of 6’7 and weighing over 260 pounds. Morgan noted Zark was missing his left arm, but Zark did not explain why he was missing his arm. Pitying Morgan, Zark would actually take Morgan under his wings but that was not the case. Morgan was actually held captive as Zark’s personal servant for the first few years where all the chores and labour would be done by Morgan as Zark would attend to his own personal matters. After a few years on the run with Zark, Morgan would learn a few things just from watching how Zark tinkers around with weapons and traps as essentially Morgan would be a fugitive on the run alongside with Zark. It took a few years for Zark to open up to Morgan with his teachings and his life. Later in his teenage years, Morgan would learn that Zark did lose his arm in a final attempt to save himself from the authorities. Using forbidden arcane arts, Zark sacrificed his arm to make it into a nuclear bomb which nuked the entire area in the wastelands enabling him to escape into the woods. Zark was not a talkative man, but Morgan did learn a lot from watching him and Morgan knew that Zark had messed with someone he should not have messed with. Zark and Morgan would travel from city to city and fight off ambush from time to time, but they spent most of their time honing Morgan’s skills in gunslinging when Zark found out that Morgan was exceptionally good at shooting.

**Journey to the South**

However, their time as master and servant/student soon came to an end when Morgan woke up abruptly from rustling and footsteps one night in a cave that both of them were hiding in for the night. To Morgan’s surprise, they were ambushed by unknown people/beings whom Morgan did not know due to [[_Ongoing Campaign/20. One Piece/Strahds Lieutenants/The Darkness\|The Darkness]] and chaos during the night. Chaos erupted within the cave as guns were fired, and different voices and screams were echoing throughout the cave. With footsteps all over the place, Morgan struggled to find Zark as men swarmed all over them inside the cave. Out of nowhere, an arm grabbed onto the back of Morgan’s garment and he was yanked backwards to be immediately flung out of the cave. When Morgan regained his sight from his grogginess, he saw Zark’s bloodied face. Zark still had a snarky smug look on his face.

“Head towards South of the woods as fast as you can, RUN!!”

“South?? What do you mean…? I can’t just leave you behind Zark!!!”

“I said RUN, you fool! you can’t read but you can understand what I’m saying right?”

“But Zark!”

“When it’s time to run, you should take my- BLRUGH”

A sword plunged through the middle of Zark’s chest and blood sprew through his mouth. Howling and laughter were heard but Morgan was petrified and everything was just a blur when things happened, however, he took one last glance at Zark’s bloodied corpse and ran with everything he had in his legs through the forest. Tears welled up in Morgan’s eyes as he ran, maybe it was his fault that Zark died. Maybe it was because of the fact that he needed to rest and they had gotten ambushed because of that. Confused and afraid, Morgan continued to run through the forest with many thoughts in his mind. Just when he thought that he finally had someone in his life, he was alone again.

“Who were they?”

“Why did they kill Zark?”

“Why did Zark tell me to run south through the woods?”

“Am I even running towards the south right now?”

“Who can I trust?”

“Who do I find?”

“Where do I go?”

“I did not even get to repay my debt to Zark”

“Maybe there’s something in the South that Zark wanted me to do”

“Whoever did this will have to PAY”

“THEY WILL PAY WITH THEIR BLOOD”

Eventually, Morgan ran south towards the woods and reached the Raven Woods. The atmosphere in the woods was significantly different as if someone or something was in the woods. The atmosphere was tense, even though it was noon, the forest was quiet. Birds were not chirping, or were there no birds at all? Morgan stopped instinctively and held his breath in a bush. Crouching, eyes darting around to find any clue of whatever was happening around him.

“I have to get out of here”

With enough rest, Morgan once again took little steps with caution and proceeded to run until he saw a river stream. Without thinking, he followed the stream as he believed that it would bring him somewhere. Thus, following the stream led Morgan to [[Worlds/Barovia/Locations/Krezk\|Krezk]].
