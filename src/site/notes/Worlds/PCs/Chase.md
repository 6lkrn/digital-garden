Arzere

|   |   |   |
|---|---|---|
|Arzere (pronounced Ar-zir), previously known by his virtue name, Chase. Arzere is the next [dragonsoul heir](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Dragonsoul_heir) of his kin, foretold by the Wonderbringer, [Kereska](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Kereska), who may or may not be the origin of his family’s draconic power.  <br>  <br>The prophecy foretells that Arzere will assist a party of fearless adventurers to confront a catastrophic disaster, possibly of [Avernus](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Avernus).<br><br>  <br><br>\|   \|   \|   \|<br>\|---\|---\|---\|<br>\|❝\|You really are a wicked one, my child, devouring the heart of evil… Are you so desperate for power? Then you shall have my humble gift as well.<br><br>  <br><br>— Kereska to Arzere\|❞\|<br><br>  <br><br>Description<br><br>---<br><br>Originally, Arzere is a Levistus tiefling of blue complexion and silvery white hair. His eyes are precious gold in color, and his thick curved horns are of dark sapphire. He also has pointy ears tipped upward.  <br>  <br>After he unconsciously consumed the mysterious heart, he manifested a more draconic and fiendish appearance; new pair of horns grown above the original horns, ganoid scales over his body parts, longer nails and sprouting wings of either a dragon or a fiend.<br><br>  <br><br>Personality<br><br>---<br><br>Despite being troublesome and mischievous as a tiefling would be, Arzere can be very kind and caring to his close acquaintances and companions, protecting them at all cost, even if it means burning them along with his enemies.<br><br>  <br><br>He is a not-so-humble person, always flirting with people of all genders (genderless included) with his terrible jokes. However, it is his lack of shame that makes him a charismatic person, just like his mother who won her half-dragon husband’s heart by her shameless humor.<br><br>  <br><br>Abilities<br><br>---<br><br>As an inexperienced sorcerer, Arzere can only cast cantrips and simple spells like Fire Bolt and Ray of Frost. One of his most favorite sorceries, however, is Aganazzar’s Scorcher, often burning his friends and foes without hesitation. He usually refers his fire spells as ‘hellfire’, just because it sounds more fearsome.<br><br>  <br><br>Out of curiosity, he also taught himself the ritual art of wizardry, being able to summon his own familiar companion and cast useful spells like Floating Disk.|![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/jv3W7IMkfro44mgFOYk0tNd5qcWUSHBQOG3B-xb4U1IK_HeOhjDMPkLDXBvsZcvEyiMZWQnIKkbqIJFSRKQnz9a9xRhV-3kiJra9R5jRFJZWH94mOdCtyGfgvmuRGlSJ_N4xUG5d1bTjl4LUKiZeuQ)|   |

Possessions

---

Arzere’s signature item is the [magical orb](https://docs.google.com/document/d/14WZ8r90CGYskPF4D58bONzlj8Hc589kAmGu9qA25rsg/edit#bookmark=id.onui3tn0ue2c) that his mother passed down to him after she discovered that her son has latent magical ability to harness sorcerous powers. At first, the orb only served as Arzere’s arcane focus to cast spells, not knowing that it actually possesses some kind of subtle energy of a divine dragon.

  

The tiefling carries two regular daggers in case he is caught up in close combat, which he named Hack and Slash. He also has a thick notebook where he documents all kinds of things he comes across during his journey, from exotic creatures to his small collection of wizard spells.

When you cast a spell that deals a type of damage from the following list, you can change that damage type to one of the other listed types: acid, cold, fire, lightning, poison, thunder.<br><br>  <br><br>[Dracorage](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Dracorage_mythal).

On a successful check, you proceed to cast the spell without losing control. On a failed check, you lose control to Dracorage, and you must cast the spell on the nearest creature(s) to you within the range of the spell.|![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/Y72HlOgr9LERxFlYc7h474y3Ji3bDt7f0RlNp3eQg0oTEN7YBvtXIIJAlbwTumrZGeXGPGgl1QX-DY6jQFFv2lGJR2M_L0lreksCeT-X__EA4F9OUoPXRSnhfwK18NpRon6OjFZ1ShwdWg6aEpazaQ)|   |
