### **Lock and Key** 

The ability to ‘lock’ and ‘unlock’ things. This includes literal locks, other people’s abilities, joints, and such. To do this, a physical key is required to channel the energy.

**Weakness**

A physical key is required for both abilities. If an opponent spends more curse energy than he does while locking something, it will be unlocked.
