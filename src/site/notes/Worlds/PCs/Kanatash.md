[[Campaigns/Players/Yianni\|Yianni]]

From a young age, Kanatash found himself being lost in his dreams.  He would always search for a deeper meaning to them and would spend many days drifting through the dream realm.

One fateful night, a dream came to Kanatash.   Bloodied and beaten corpses everywhere, a wasteland of the dead.  In the middle of this field of dead stood a hulking monstrosity holding a flag pole twice the size of it.  The flag bore a symbol, not one that Kanatash recognised but one that was familiar.

Upon awaking from his dream Kanatash knew what it meant.  It was his destiny to prevent this evil force from destroying the world.

With little knowledge, skill or money, Kanatash left his family home in search of this great evil.
