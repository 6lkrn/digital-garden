The Family

Claramay-of-the-South-Western-Sea is a mermaid born in a small cove of the South Western Sea. From her birth, she was surrounded by a family that values their heritage of sticking together. Said heritage however, was not upheld by her dear grandpapa, who was a hardened adventurer in his own right. Back in his younger days, the merman joined a group of adventurers who amassed wealth via quests. He would come back to the sea near the small cove of the South Western Sea periodically but never went back to land after a certain quest, old age made his longing for the seas too strong to push away.

Back to the sea near the small cove, the merman Jaladri-of-the-Strength-of the-Waves was treated like an oddity. After all, it was and still is uncommon for merfolk to want to spend prolonged life out of water and away from the seas. Him bringing back outside knowledge and sharing it to the small community helped ease his return to the merfolk colony, though. Moreso was his ties with the people who seemed to have some influence on land dweller law. His children, however, were not as easily appeased. They resented him for not being in the picture as they grew, missing milestones in their life. Though they are all children of the sea, like any other merfolk, they too, were children of Jaladri-of-the-Strength-of-the-Waves, as he called himself now. And what good is having a father if he is usually not around when you need him?

When confronted about it, her grandmama, Alda-of-the-Beauty-of-the-Corals told her children that she did not really care what her partner does. She was a simple mermaid. In her mind, she had time for herself and her children, her partner would come back home with wealth and when he went away, the small colony would help her with raising the children. All she cared for was that her children grew to be good merfolk and had families of their own. Since all four of her children achieved said target she had for them, she deemed everything is fine with her life.

However, the collective resentment rubbed off on some of Claramay’s cousins. As a result, there were some who outrightly rejected his efforts in building a relationship with them and others who were only cordial out of pity. Claramay lapped each and every story the old merman had to offer, though. He made adventuring sound attractive and intriguing to the young mermaid. Even though her parents frowned upon this relationship the old merman and the young mermaid were fostering, the duo carried on. Claramay would often sneak out behind her parent’s back to meet her grandpapa and her grandpapa in return would frequently take her out to his personal shelter, where he kept his old gear and memorabilia from his adventuring times. Her older brothers and her younger sister do not join in this interest, outgrowing them as they age, much to their parents' expectation. Rather, they are more keen in learning the usual trades other merfolk have. The eldest is training to become a sea-creature handler, the second is learning secrets behind seaweed propagation and the youngest child has taken a place in the local nursery. 

In time between her meeting with her grandpapa, Claramay studied with the local songstress to better control the magic in her voice - like every other siren could. There, she would be told of the songstress' flings with land dwellers. She was told they could be manipulated and that most could not be trusted. But she was also told that they are most peculiar and fun to be around.

The Change

By the time Claramay was 22, her grandmama returned to the seas, becoming seafoams. Her grandpapa was brokenhearted, for despite their neutral relationship he did in fact, love her very much. Their home was turned into a shrine for Sedna the shifter of the seas,much to his children's annoyance. He exclusively lived at his shelter after that. The old merman stopped communicating with others, only with anyone who'd come and visit. A year later he followed his wife and returned to the seas himself.

In his death was a formal will, notarised and legal by the law of the merfolk in the sea near the small cove of the South Western Sea. No one was sure when he left home to get it done. But it was done. So his family took a day out of their lives and listened to the will reading. Surely the patriarch would turn over and be a good father to them this time. At least in his death. 

He left almost everything to Claramay. The shelter, the items in it, the huge amount of gold he had stored and a heartfelt letter. The letter detailed how he was sorry for not being there for his family, though he doesn't regret living a life as an adventurer. He wished Claramay a good and fulfilled life and hoped the inheritance would be of much help to her in the future. To the rest of his family, he left personalised trinkets- things he gathered through his quests that reminded him of them.

The family was in an uproar. Legal battle commenced almost immediately. It took 3 years for the dust to settle. The will was honoured. No amount of legal jargon or swears or curses or guilt tripping or honey laced words can change that. Tired of the whole fiasco, Claramay decided to run from the sea near the small cove of the South Western Sea. She bestowed her attorney power on the inheritance to protect them when she's away. 

Just like that, the mermaid finds herself on land,trying her hand on being an adventurer. Like her grandpapa before her.
