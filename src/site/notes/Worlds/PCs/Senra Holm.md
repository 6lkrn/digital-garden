## Class Features

As a monster, you gain the following class features.

#### Hit Points

---

- Hit Dice: 1d4 per monster level
    
- Hit Points at 1st Level: 4 + your Constitution modifier
    
- Hit Points at Higher Levels: 1d4 (or 3) + your Constitution modifier per monster level after 1st
    

#### Proficiencies

---

- Armor: None
    
- Weapons: Simple weapons
    
- Tools: None
    

---

- Saving Throws: Strength, Constitution
    
- Skills: Choose any two from Acrobatics, Athletics, Perception, Stealth, Survival, or Intimidation
    

  

#### Equipment

You start with the following equipment, in addition to the equipment granted by your background:

- (a) a light crossbow and 20 bolts or (b) any simple weapon
    
- (a) an explorer's pack or (b) a dungeoneer's pack
    
- Any simple weapon and two daggers
    

### Inhuman Strength

Beginning at 1st level, your inner monster gives you enhanced strength. You can roll a d6  in place of the normal damage of your unarmed strikes and weapon attacks, as long as the ability score you use to determine the attack and damage rolls is Strength. You cannot use your Inhuman Strength in conjunction with a monk's Martial Arts, or other similar abilities. This die changes based on the Dmg table at the beginning of the class page.

### Accursed Powers

Your inner monster shares with you some of its horrible power, granting you dark gifts to wield against your foes.

You gain one accursed power of your choice. Your accursed power options are detailed at the end of the class description. When you gain certain monster levels, you gain additional accursed powers of your choice, as shown in the Accursed Powers column of the Monster table.  
  
Beast Hide ⬥︎

.While you have unleashed your monstrous form, your Armor Class equals 10 + your Dexterity modifier + your Constitution modifier.

  

### Unleash ⬥︎

The monster writhes within you, ready to be unleashed.

As an action, you can unleash your monstrous form. On the turn that you unleash your monstrous form, you can make one attack as a bonus action.

Additionally, choose one type of creature that is not humanoid. Each time you unleash, you count as this type of creature for the purposes of spells and effects that affect different types of creatures. This choice also affects which Accursed Powers you are able to gain.

While in this form, the following rules apply:

- Your Monster Hit Points shown in the Monster table. Monster Hit Points are functionally identical to hit points, and changes to your Monster Hit Point pool do not affect your hit point pool, or vice versa.
    
- You count as a shapeshifter for the purpose of spells.
    
- You are resistant to slashing, piercing and bludgeoning damage from non silvered weapons.
    
- Your unarmed strikes can deal slashing, piercing or bludgeoning.
    
- You retain the benefit of any features from your class, race, or other source and can use them if your monstrous form is physically capable of doing so.
    
- You do not benefit from any tool or vehicle proficiencies while in this form.
    
- If you are a Small or smaller creature, you become a Medium sized creature while in your monstrous form.
    
- You cannot cast or concentrate on spells, unless otherwise specified.
    

- You choose whether your  
    equipment falls to the ground  
    in your space, merges into your  
    new form, or is worn by it when you  
    unleash your monstrous form. Worn  
    equipment functions as normal, but the  
    DM decides whether it is practical for your monstrous form to wear a piece of equipment. Your equipment doesn't change size or shape to match your monstrous form, and any equipment that your monstrous form can't wear must either fall to the ground or merge with it. Equipment that merges with your monstrous form has no effect until you return to your human form.
    
- If you drop to 0 Monster Hit Points, you revert to your human form, taking any excess damage in that form, and are unconscious until the start of your next turn. If the excess damage you take reduces you to 0 hit points, then you instead remain unconscious.
    

  

#### Healing the Monster ⬥︎

Even your ferocious inner monster must have time to lick its wounds. You regain all lost Monster Hit Points at the end of a long rest. If you regain hit points during a short rest, you regain Monster Hit Points equal to the amount regained.

Additionally, if you unleash your monstrous form while you have 0 Monster Hit Points, you regain 1 Monster Hit Point.

#### Containing the Monster ⬥︎

While in your human form, you are unstable and erratic, using all of your willpower to contain the monster within you.

Whenever you take damage equal to half or more of your current maximum hit points while in your human form, you must make a Charisma saving throw. The DC for this saving throw is equal to 10, or half the damage taken, whichever is highest. If you fail this saving throw, you immediately unleash your monstrous form.

Additionally, when you drop to 0 hit points, you can, instead of falling unconscious, unleash your monstrous form. You cannot do this if you have already been in your monstrous form on the same turn.

#### Controlling the Monster ⬥︎

After one minute in your monstrous form, you begin to lose control of your inner monster. To retain control you must return to your human form.

Returning to human form at any time requires you to make a Charisma check on your turn, the DC for which is equal to 20 - your proficiency bonus. On a success, you return to your human form. On a failed check, you lose control of your monstrous form, and must attack the closest creature to you. Each time you fail this check, the DC decreases by 2. Once you have reverted to your human form, the DC returns to 20 - your proficiency bonus.

If there aren't any creatures nearby, or there are multiple creatures close to you, the DM decides what your character does. At the start of each subsequent round, you can repeat the check, but on each failure you must use your turn to attack the creature closest to you (the failed check does not count as an action). On a successful check, your action is used returning to your human form.

Additionally, If you fail a roll to revert to your human form, you can choose to gain 2 levels of exhaustion to instantly revert back instead.

#### Withstanding the Monster ⬥︎

You have a limit to how much of your inner monster's sheer ferocity you can withstand. The amount of times you can unleash safely is equal to your Charisma modifier + 1 (minimum 2). This number resets after completing a long rest.

Each time you unleash your inner monster after this amount is harmful to your mind and body. After unleashing, you immediately gain one level of exhaustion and lose control of your monstrous form.

### Begrudging Union ⬥︎

By 2nd level, you have learned to exercise a small amount of control over the beast within you. When you use your unleash ability, you can automatically succeed on the Charisma check required to revert back to human form. Once you have used this ability, you must complete a short or long rest before it can be used again.

At 10th level, you can use this ability twice before having to complete a short or long rest.

### Haunted Resolve

By 2nd level, you have seen things no mortal should ever have to witness, forcing you to fortify your will against the horrors of your new life. You have advantage on saving throws against being frightened.

### Monstrous Archetype

At 3rd level, you choose an archetype that describes your unique path of violence as a monster. Choose Menace, Stalker, or Pact Maker, all detailed at the end of the class description. Your choice grants you features at 3rd level and again at 7th, 13th, and 18th level.

### Ability Score Improvement

When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.

### Extra Attack ⬥︎

Beginning at 5th level, the monster within you has grown faster. You can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn while in your monstrous form.

### Quick Transformation ⬥︎

Also at 5th level, you have begun to embrace the power granted by your inner monster. You can use a bonus action instead of an action to unleash your monstrous form.

### Magical Fury ⬥︎

Your prolonged union with your inner monster has awakened a sinister magic. At 6th level, your unarmed strikes while in monstrous form count as magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage.

### Enhanced Constitution

Also at 6th level, your body courses with powerful beast blood. Once per minute, you regain 1 hp. This ability is negated for 10 minutes if you take damage from a silvered weapon or are targeted by a spell that forces you into your true form.  
  
Heightened Control ⬥︎

Your control over your monster’s power grows stronger each day. At 9th level, you can remain in your monstrous form for 1 hour before you risk losing control and must attempt to revert to your human form.

### Relentless Wrath ⬥︎

By 11th level, your monster has grown more ferocious and destructive than ever. 

Your body furiously resowes wounds as you reach your wits end. If you drop to 0 hit points while in your monster form you don't transform back outright, you can make a dc 10 constitution saving throw. If you succeed you drop to 1 hit point instead.  
  
Each time you use this feature the dc is increased by 5. When you finish a short or long rest, the dc reset to 10. 

### Devouring jaws ⬥︎

At 14th level, you can unleash your primal hunger in a devastating bite. While in your monster form you can make a special attack as part of your attack action. You bite down on an enemy creature as part of your natural attack. If the attack hits you gain temporary hit points equal to the damage dealt.  
  
Legendary Might  ⬥︎

By 17th level, you have attained the might of a legendary monster. While in your monstrous form, when you fail a saving throw, you can choose to instead succeed.

Once you have used this ability, you must finish a long rest before you can use it again.

### Monster Unleashed ⬥︎

At 20th level, you have become one with the monster within you. You can now unleash your monster, and revert to human form, as a bonus action at will, without having to make a Charisma check to retain control. You cannot lose control of your inner monster, and you ignore the levels of exhaustion gained by unleashing your monstrous form more times than you can withstand.  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
Stalker

The Stalker archetype embodies fear, the path of those who creep through darkness, waiting for the perfect moment to strike. Those who follow this monstrous archetype often enjoy their time as a monster. They relish the terror they inflict upon others, and carefully plan their transformations so that they can lose control where there are weak and defenseless victims to prey upon.

##### Stalker Features

|   |   |
|---|---|
|Monster Level|Feature|
|3rd|Haunting Gaze, Night stalker|
|7th|Paralyzed by Fear|
|13th|Call Shadows|
|18th|Haunting Presence|

#### Haunting Gaze

When you choose this archetype at 3rd level, your very gaze is enough to instill fear in your victims. As a bonus action, you can look at a creature within 30 feet of you and force it to make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is frightened of you for 1 minute, or until you stop concentrating (as if concentrating on a spell). A creature has disadvantage on their saving throw if you use your haunting gaze on the same turn that you unleash your monstrous form. A frightened creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of their turn. A creature that succeeds on their saving throw is immune to your haunting gaze for 24 hours.

You can use this ability a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum 1), regaining all expended uses on a long rest. The DC for this ability is equal to 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier.

### Night stalker

Also at 3rd level you have advantage on dexterity (stealth) checks while in an area of dim light or darkness.

#### Paralyzed by Fear

At 7th level, your gaze is so powerful it now immobilizes your prey. Creatures affected by your Haunting Gaze become paralyzed, rather than frightened.

#### Call Shadows ⬥︎

By 13th level, you can call the very shadows to your side as you torment your prey. While in your monstrous form and in an area of dim light or darkness, you can use a bonus action to become invisible until the start of your next turn. While invisible in this way, your movement doesn't provoke opportunity attacks.

  

#### Haunting Presence

At 18th level, you have become a creature of nightmare, no longer needing to lock eyes with your prey to paralyze it with fear. When you use your haunting gaze while in your monstrous form, you can attempt to instill fear in the hearts of any number of creatures you choose within 30 feet of you that you can see.

  

  

  

  

Accursed powers

#### Heightened Senses

The monster within you longs for the hunt. You have advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight, hearing or smell.

#### Unnatural Talent

Choose one of your monster skill proficiencies. Your proficiency bonus is doubled for any ability check you make that uses this chosen proficiency.

Otherworldly leap

Your jump distance is tripled while you unleash your monster form.

  
Beast speech

While you unleash your monster form, you may freely speak to animals as if under the effects of speak with animals.

  
Colossal Form

Prerequisite: 14th level

When you unleash your monstrous form, you can choose to become Large in size. When you do so, the reach for your unarmed strikes increases by 5 feet. As an action while in your monstrous form, you can morph between Large and Medium size.

While raging, you gain the following benefits if you aren’t wearing heavy armor:

- You have advantage on Strength checks and Strength saving throws.

- You have resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage.
    

If you are able to cast spells, you can’t cast them or concentrate on them while raging.

Your rage lasts for 1 minute.

You can also end your rage on your turn as a bonus action.

Once you have raged the number of times shown for your barbarian level in the Rages column of the Barbarian table, you must finish a long rest before you can rage again.

Unarmored Defense

While you are not wearing any armor, your Armor Class equals 10 + your Dexterity modifier + your Constitution modifier. You can use a shield and still gain this benefit.

Reckless Attack

Starting at 2nd level, you can throw aside all concern for defense to attack with fierce desperation. When you make your first attack on your turn, you can decide to attack recklessly. Doing so gives you advantage on melee weapon attack rolls using Strength during this turn, but attack rolls against you have advantage until your next turn.

Danger Sense

At 2nd level, you gain an uncanny sense of when things nearby aren’t as they should be, giving you an edge when you dodge away from danger.

Using the optional feats rule, you can forgo taking this feature to take a feat of your choice instead.

Extra Attack

Beginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the [Attack](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/combat#Attack) action on your turn.

Fast Movement

Starting at 5th level, your speed increases by 10 feet while you aren’t wearing heavy armor.

Feral Instinct

By 7th level, your instincts are so honed that you have advantage on initiative rolls.

Additionally, if you are surprised at the beginning of combat and aren’t [incapacitated](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Incapacitated), you can act normally on your first turn, but only if you enter your rage before doing anything else on that turn.

Brutal Critical

Beginning at 9th level, you can roll one additional weapon damage die when determining the extra damage for a critical hit with a melee attack.

This increases to two additional dice at 13th level and three additional dice at 17th level.

Relentless Rage

Starting at 11th level, your rage can keep you fighting despite grievous wounds. If you drop to 0 hit points while you’re raging and don’t die outright, you can make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw. If you succeed, you drop to 1 hit point instead.

Each time you use this feature after the first, the DC increases by 5. When you finish a short or long rest, the DC resets to 10.

Brutal Critical

At 13th level, you can roll two additional weapon damage dice when determining the extra damage for a critical hit with a melee attack.

This increases to three additional dice at 17th level.

Persistent Rage

Beginning at 15th level, your rage is so fierce that it ends early only if you fall [unconscious](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Unconscious) or if you choose to end it.

Brutal Critical

At 17th level, you can roll three additional weapon damage dice when determining the extra damage for a critical hit with a melee attack.

Indomitable Might

Beginning at 18th level, if your total for a Strength check is less than your Strength score, you can use that score in place of the total.

Humanity

Those cursed with lycanthropy live in constant turmoil, fighting between instincts of man and beast. This is represented as humanity points. Many of your abilities cost humanity points to enact while in your monster form, while many abilities in human form restore your humanity.  The amount of humanity points you have are displayed on the class chart.

You regain 1 point of humanity after a long rest. Your amount of humanity points is persistent and stays from session to session. While in your humanoid form you are unstable and erratic, trying to contain your monstrous form. 

You can also regain humanity points by being given them by the dm, this happens when your character lives out humanizing moments, at your dms discretion.

Whenever you take damage equal to half or more of your current maximum hit points while in your human form, you must make a Charisma saving throw. The DC for this saving throw is equal to 10, or half the damage taken, whichever is highest. If you fail this saving throw, you immediately unleash your monstrous form.

  

As you lose humanity, your stats reflect that. You will gain the effect of certain features only when you have low humanity and vice versa. Every two missing points in humanity also reduces your Intelligence and charisma by 1 point, while raising your strength and wisdom 

by 1.

  

Unleash

You unleash your true form, turning into a primal beast. As an action you shapechange into your true form as a lycanthrope, spending 1 point of humanity. While transformed, you inherit your attributes and proficiencies. Your transformation lasts for 1 minute.

Your werewolves Hit Points acts as a secondary health pool while you are transformed, and changes to your werewolves Point pool do not affect your hit point pool, or vice versa.  
You retain the benefit of any features from your class, race, or other source and can use them if your monstrous form is physically capable of doing so.You choose whether your equipment falls to the ground in your space, merges into your new form, or is worn by it when you unleash your monstrous form. Worn Equipment functions as normal, but the DM decides whether it is practical for your monstrous form to wear a piece of equipment. Your equipment doesn't change size or shape to match your monstrous form, and any equipment that your monstrous form can't wear must either fall to the ground or merge with it. Equipment that merges with your monstrous form has no effect until you return to your human form.

Some features in the werewolf stat block require you to be a certain level before you have access to them. You can transform a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus divided by 2 (rounded down)  before you must take a long rest.

Attack rolls against you have advantage, but all damage is split between you and the creature you are grappling.<br><br>While you are grappling an enemy in this way, you cannot make additional bite attacks.|

  

Healing the Monster

Even your ferocious inner monster must have time to lick its wounds. You regain all lost  werewolf hit points at the end of a long rest. If you regain hit points during a short rest, you regain Monster Hit Points equal to the amount regained. Additionally, if you unleash your monstrous form while you have 0 Monster Hit Points, you regain 1 Monster Hit Point.

  

Enhanced Sense
