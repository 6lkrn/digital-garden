Eldrin Astorio was born in Ilshona, an elven town. His mother, Elaria is a single mother. His father from what he gathered from his mother stories, is an adventurer that had come to the town some years ago, after some time with his mother, he left and his mother got pregnant with him.

Both he and his mother live on the outskirts of the town, when asked why they live so far away from others, his mother always said that people are bigots and are jealous of them. 

When he was 8 years old, Elaria started to teach him the way of the sword, he took to the sword like a natural. He became more proficient with the rapier and scimitar as the training progressed. When asked why he needs to train, his mother answered he needs to be strong to protect her and perhaps someday someone that is important to him.

One of his hobbies when he gets down time is to play a little tune on his flute. He noticed that whenever he played his flute, his mother's eyes seemed to be wet as if she had been crying. One of his favourite tunes to play was Binks Sake.

A tragedy struck Ilshona when he was 10 years old, bandits came and attacked the village, every single villager was pillaged but since Eldrin and Elaria lived on the outskirts, they had time to collect themselves and run. However, as they were running Elaria was shot down. 

Elaria as she is bleeding to death said to Eldrin "Run, save yourself. Live your life to its fullest, be kind, find someone that you will love all your life" 

He tried to drag Elaria with him but she pushed him away as the bandits got near them.

Eldrin, distraught, lonely and lost, stumbled upon a big tent on the seventh day after he left the village. He walked to the big tent and fainted at the entrance of the tent. When he came to, he was greeted by a friendly looking old [[gnome\|gnome]], who gave him some bread and soup to eat. He ate it with gusto and promptly fell back to sleep after.

When he woke up the second time, the [[gnome\|gnome]] wasn't there. He walked outside the tent he was in and saw a lot of people gathering around the big tent he fainted in front. He also saw a man breathing fire, a juggler and he also heard merry music coming from the surrounding areas.

He walks around and curiously looks around and eventually he finds the old [[gnome\|gnome]] that gave him soup earlier, playing a violin and seemed to be one of the sources of music. The old [[gnome\|gnome]] saw him and nodded, smiling merrily at him. The [[gnome\|gnome]] waves him over and asks if he wants to join in, and plays that flute of his. Eldrin nodded and he joined in, feeling elated for the moment, but deep inside he felt a sadness welling. 

After the song was over, the [[gnome\|gnome]] clapped Eldrin on the shoulder (he was standing on top of boxes) and asked Eldrin, if he is better now? Eldrin cried when he was asked that and it took the [[gnome\|gnome]] and several other people to calm him down before he could tell what had happened. 

They listened to him and the [[gnome\|gnome]] beckoned Eldrin to follow him, they went and met with the Master of the Circus, he looks to be an [[elf\|elf]] but later on Eldrin would learn that the master was a Fey. He told the master again about what had happened, and the master gave him an option, the master could give him gold and he could go on living his life or he could join Herr Levine's Circus of Wonders and make money and have people protect him.

Eldrin accepted the offer and began working with Herr Levine's. He was put under the tutelage of the old [[gnome\|gnome]] whose name is Larkost Hilltopple, he learned other instruments under the tutelage of Larkost. 

He worked with the Circus for 13 years before he decided to be on his own. He bid farewell to his found family and he went on his way to find his own adventure. He travelled to one of the port towns with a spring in his steps. In his head wondering what great adventure is waiting for him, and if he can find his long lost father and if possible enact revenge on his mother's murderers. 

### ADDENDUM 

His time with the Circus was a bit of a blur, they are always moving never in a town for too long. They usually stayed in town for 1 to 2 days max, however there was an incident that made them stay in a town for a month. The incident was one of the performers who were arrested on the charge of thievery, solicitation and unruly behaviour when being detained. The performer’s name was Qaerr, she is an [[Eagle\|Eagle]] [[Aarakocra\|Aarakocra]]. During the month they were stranded in Oar’s Rest, several weird things happened. 

One of the weird things that happened was the case of Qaerr detainment. Even though she was a beauty, she would never give herself to prostitution, she is also not one of the pickpockets and she is one of the calm ones. Her whole performance depends on her being the cool bird she is, she is/was an escape artist. After her detainment, Herr Levine tried to appeal her innocence. However, before the appeal was able to go through, the Lawmaster was assassinated. 

Of course the blame falls unto them; the circus. As apparently, Lawmaster Stillfinger; a [[halfling\|halfling]], was beloved by the town as he is just and will not bend to bribery. In hindsight, that’s probably why he was assassinated. 

Anyway; after they were accused, Herr Levine asked us to scatter and to hide and if we could investigate the town. Herr Levine then teleported back to the Feywild and left the 10 of them to fend for themselves. 

After a bit of sleuthing work, some sweet talking. Eldrin, Vroth ([[half-orc\|half-orc]] strong man), Lady Lily ([[human\|human]] seer), Larkost ([[gnome\|gnome]] bard/fighter) were able to find out the reason for the weird town situation. The town was controlled by an Incubus and Succubus duo.

After a rather intense fight, they were able to vanquish the duo back to the hells or wherever they are from. Eldrin got some souvenirs after the battle, two gold earrings and a black pearl that he also turned into earrings. After celebrating their victory, Herr Levine Circus, move on back on the road.
