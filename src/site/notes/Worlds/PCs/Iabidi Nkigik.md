|# FEATURES & TRAITS|
|CLASS FEATURES|
|Potent Aptitude. Your technological experience lends you an uncommon insight that you can use to bolster your allies. To do so, you use a bonus action on your turn to choose one creature other than yourself within 60 feet of you who can hear you. That creature gains one Potent Aptitude die, a d4. This die changes as you gain engineer levels, as shown in the Potent Aptitude column of the engineer table. Once within the next 10 minutes, the creature can roll the die and add the number rolled to one ability check, attack roll, or saving throw it makes. The creature can wait until after it rolls the d20 before deciding to use the Potent Aptitude die, but must decide before the GM says whether the roll succeeds or fails. Once the Potent Aptitude die is rolled, it is lost. A creature can have only one Potent Aptitude die at a time. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, as shown in the engineer table. You regain any expended uses when you finish a short or long rest.<br><br>  <br><br>Techcasting (Engineer 1st level).  During your training you have derived powers from schematics with the aid of your wrist pad. See chapter 10 for the general rules of techcasting and chapter 12 for the tech powers list.<br><br>  <br><br>Infuse Item (Engineer 2nd level). You gain the ability to temporarily enhance a weapon or armor. At the end of a long rest, you can touch one unenhanced object that is a suit of armor, a shield, or a simple or martial weapon. Until the end of your next long rest or until you die, the object becomes an enhanced item, granting a +1 bonus to AC if it’s armor or a shield or a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls if it’s a weapon. Once you’ve used this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest. This bonus increases to +2 at 10th level and +3 at 15th level. Your quick thinking and agility allow you to move and act quickly. You can take a bonus action on each of your turns in combat. This action can be used only to take the Dash, Disengage, or Hide action.<br><br>  <br><br>Tool Expertise (Engineer 2nd level).

You learn to modify an unenhanced lightsaber utilizing your artificer knowledge. Over the course of a long rest, you can modify your lightsaber. You must have the lightsaber and artificer’s implements in order to perform this modification.<br><br>  <br><br>Your modified lightsaber is enhanced, requires attunement, can only be used by you, and counts as a tech focus for your tech powers while you are attuned to it. Your modified lightsaber has 4 modification slots, and it gains more at higher levels, as shown in the Modification Slots column of the engineer table. For each modification installed in excess of your proficiency bonus, your tech point maximum is reduced by 1. Over the course of a long rest, you can install, replace, or remove a number of modifications up to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of one).<br><br>  <br><br>Some modification effects require saving throws. When you use such an effect from this class, the DC equals your tech save DC.<br><br>  <br><br>At 9th level, you can maintain two different modified lightsabers. The total modification slots are split across the two items.<br><br>  <br>  <br><br>Force Resonance (Artificer Engineer 3rd level). Once per round, when you hit a creature with your modified lightsaber, you can expend one use of your Potent Aptitude to deal an extra 2d6 damage to that target. The damage is the same type as your modified lightsaber’s damage.<br><br>  <br><br>The damage increases when you reach certain levels in this class, increasing to 3d6 at 5th level, 5d6 at 11th level, and 8d6 at 17th level.<br><br>  <br>  <br><br>Ability Score Improvement. (Engineer 4th, 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level)<br><br>You can increase one ability score by 2, or you can increase two ability scores by 1.
