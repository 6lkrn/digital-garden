The Sparrow

  
Chiba Suzume was born a frail child, almost succumbing to death multiple times before reaching her first year. Her father Chiba Itsuki was happy to welcome her, doting on the baby and worrying about the child whenever. He even got the doctor to stay near the family home, giving the doctor a temporary residence. Sometimes, the doctor would even stay in a room at the house itself. Her mother Chiba Yuriko fretted as much, though this was her second birth, losing a child was her ultimate nightmare at that time. Her mother-in-law was mostly critical, though there were times she softened up, being worried about her grandchild as much as the others. Her brother, Chiba Taka doted on her, too. He was six years older than her but was happy to have a younger sister. The first person he’d meet whenever he comes back home would be Suzume. More often than not, he would shower her with gifts from his journey and wars.

  

Suzume grew to be a stronger child, though she was always reminded about her near deaths. So too, were the people of her clan. As such, there is always a retainer or two following her like shadows, more so than what was usually expected for the child of a clan head. She has a good relationship with the retainers from this, though. Her favourites are Mako and Hotaru, gentlemen in her eyes. They were her father’s men, who followed him to previous wars and triumphed. 

  

Unfortunately, when she was 14, her father and brother went off to another war and lost their lives there, despite their clan winning. As punishment, the clan was severed, becoming a small clan. Yuriko took over as head as her only child was too young to take over and her mother-in-law was too old. They were alone, except for the retainers and vassals who stayed. Yuriko did her best to maintain the clan, rather than reaching for new heights, out of sorrow from her sudden loss. She kept an amicable relationship with everyone she could, trying to build a non-threatening reputation for the Chiba clan, if only till Suzume was old enough to take over.

  

Now with Suzume 18 of age, Yuriko and the retainers deem her mature enough to take over as clan head. 

  

Being clan head was something she was trained to be, but Suzume would need all the assistance she could get, as she secretly wishes to regain the glory her deceased father had during his time as clan head. After all, it was their right.
