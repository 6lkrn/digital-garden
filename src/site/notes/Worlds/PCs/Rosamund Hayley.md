Rosamund grew up in the home of a well to do magistrate. A man of honour and justice, he followed the law to the letter. A man that broke no law and never suffered another to break one either. A respected and feared man, he strove to improve the city and its laws. He never took bribes, an oddity in the highly corrupt land. This meant that while he wasn't rich, he could always provide. Rosamund’s mother suffered their lower income with courage.  

Rosamund was born in a loving family and grew up with the best education her parents could provide. An intelligent girl, he did well in school and was intent on following her father into law and becoming the next great Justice of the city.   

Unfortunately for her and the legal world, her father made a lot of enemies. Eventually he made the wrong kind of enemies. He began to fight with the corrupt leaders of the city. A fight he was in no position to win. Soon they fabricated false evidence and arrested her father. The very law he had fought to protect became his death sentence.

Rosamund watched in terror as her world came crashing down around her. Her father lost his position as a respected magistrate. He was dishonoured and transferred to the [slums?] of the city. Given a tiny stipend to manage his affairs and ordered to manage the legal cases of petty criminals and thieves. She watched as she lost her position in the prestigious law school. As they left her beloved childhood house to live in the slums. As her rich and powerful friends abandoned her and the shame surrounding her family. She watched as her father shrunk into a weak phantom of himself. A shadow creature that worked all day and everyday to still do the right thing. She watched as he worked himself to the bone, never to be the same, tall, brave, symbol of justice he had once been. She watched as they fought to make a living in the back alleys of the city. She watched them struggle to provide for her and her baby brother, who had only known poverty and the grime of the city. 

She watched as her mother died.

They could not afford her medicine. And finally she watched as her father walked away from her mother’s grave, back to his work, never to return. 

And at that same grave she took an oath. To never follow the law, to never be poor, to never have morals, to never be kind, to never be giving and most of all, to never be brave.  
  
That was the last time she cried.
