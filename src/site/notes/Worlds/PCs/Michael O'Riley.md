Steps-

1. Choose age (max 15).
    
2. Determine max luck points ( equal to 15 - your age).
    
3. The number of points you can spend on your char = your age (max 5 per stat)
    
4. Determine max broken stat (equal to your sturdiness modifier + 5).
    
5. Your Skills have the same bonus as the relevant stat (ie. if your phys is 3, your force and intimidation are also 3).
    
6. Pick a character type from the list.
    
7. Add a +3 to the modifiers of the key skills from your kid type.
    
8. Decide on an iconic item, your iconic item gives a +2 to any rolls made using the item. 
    
9. Decide your appearance and gender
    
10. Choose your drive, anchor, problem and pride. There are examples in the google doc but you are free to come up with your own. 
    
11. Describe your relationships with the other children and important npcs.
    
12. Decide on a hideout for your group of friends.
