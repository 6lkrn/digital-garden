|Description|
|Daniel tries hard. Some may call him a brown-noser, but he knows full well he is proving himself to the world. He’s by-the-book and believes that following the rules and to abide by the law is the utmost important thing in the world. He is the lone survivor of a triplet. Both of his brothers died from a car accident involving a drunk driver. Daniel experienced first hand the failings of the law he cared for so much when the drunk driver was let off the hook. He still firmly follows the laws, though, perhaps out of habit.<br><br>  <br><br>Daniel’s a scrawny, noodle-armed boy with a slightly chubby face who will try to settle things down with his brain rather than his brawn. He’s all about the light academia aesthetics. He’s kind but can be a bit pushy and strict. Very money conscious.|

| Family: <br><br>Robert Smith : Older brother. He was close with his dog Snowy and was very dependable. I looked up to him, but I’d rather not be compared to him. He died from a car accident involving a drunk driver.<br><br>  <br><br>William Dietrich Smith: Youngest brother. People keep saying he was a bit strange. But I think he was just being himself. I wanted him to feel like a bigger man. He died from a car accident involving a drunk driver.<br><br>  <br><br>[[Worlds/Other worlds/NPCs/Nancy-Ann Smith\|Nancy-Ann Smith]]: Mum. She isn’t quite the same after Bobby and Will are gone. Sometimes she forgets to cook and bathe. I know she’s sad so I need to be good and make her happy. Mum used to work as a clerk at school but stopped after the accident.<br><br>  <br><br>James Smith: Dad. He works hard, but seems to be working harder after Bobby and Will are gone. He’s always gone for out-of-state work. He told me to take care of mum when he’s gone. He works at the facility. He said he handled documents there. |     |
| Npc 1: [[Worlds/Other worlds/NPCs/Dean Johnson\|Dean Johnson]] : He’s my mum’s older brother. He’s very close to mum and she listens to him, sometimes a bit more than she listens to dad. He handles a lot of cases and is usually busy. He represented us against the drunk driver, but the drunk driver’s lawyer was older and knew better. He gives gifts every time he comes to visit, which is often. <br><br>Tries his best to be a good person but buckles down to financial pressure. Would do *a lot* to gain cases and clients.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |     |

### Description

Daniel tries hard. Some may call him a brown-noser, but he knows full well he is proving himself to the world. He’s by-the-book and believes that following the rules and to abide by the law is the utmost important thing in the world. He is the lone survivor of a triplet. Both of his brothers died from a car accident involving a drunk driver. Daniel experienced first hand the failings of the law he cared for so much when the drunk driver was let off the hook. He still firmly follows the laws, though, perhaps out of habit. 

Daniel’s a scrawny, noodle-armed boy with a slightly chubby face who will try to settle things down with his brain rather than his brawn. He’s all about the light academia aesthetics. He’s kind but can be a bit pushy and strict. Very money conscious.

#### Family: 
[[Worlds/PCs/Robert Smith\|Robert Smith]] : Older brother. He was close with his dog Snowy and was very dependable. I looked up to him, but I’d rather not be compared to him. He died from a car accident involving a drunk driver.

[[Worlds/PCs/William Dietrich Smith\|William Dietrich Smith]]: Youngest brother. People keep saying he was a bit strange. But I think he was just being himself. I wanted him to feel like a bigger man. He died from a car accident involving a drunk driver.

[[Worlds/Other worlds/NPCs/Nancy-Ann Smith\|Nancy-Ann Smith]]: Mum. She isn’t quite the same after Bobby and Will are gone. Sometimes she forgets to cook and bathe. I know she’s sad so I need to be good and make her happy. Mum used to work as a clerk at school but stopped after the accident.

[[Worlds/Other worlds/NPCs/James Smith\|James Smith]]: Dad. He works hard, but seems to be working harder after Bobby and Will are gone. He’s always gone for out-of-state work. He told me to take care of mum when he’s gone. He works at the facility. He said he handled documents there. 

Npc 1: [[Worlds/Other worlds/NPCs/Dean Johnson\|Dean Johnson]] : He’s my mum’s older brother. He’s very close to mum and she listens to him, sometimes a bit more than she listens to dad. He handles a lot of cases and is usually busy. He represented us against the drunk driver, but the drunk driver’s lawyer was older and knew better. He gives gifts every time he comes to visit, which is often. 

Tries his best to be a good person but buckles down to financial pressure. Would do *a lot* to gain cases and clients.

Npc 2: [[Worlds/Other worlds/NPCs/Mrs. Erma\|Mrs. Erma]] : Neighbour. She has a head full of white hair and always smells of cookies. She likes coming over and having chats with mum. She would have dinner with us every week. She would also invite us over for cookies and cocoa. She has a lot of cats and loves knitting.

Npc 3: [[Worlds/Other worlds/NPCs/Renzo Steadman\|Renzo Steadman]]: He’s a new student in my class, awkward, proper and is a genius. He wears thick glasses. He wants to be a geneticist. His father is one. The family is well off. He has a driver named Nate and a robot maid named Miss Adelaide.

Npc 4: Mr. [[Worlds/Other worlds/NPCs/Antonio Raffaele Zamboni\|Antonio Raffaele Zamboni]] (Tony). He’s a friend of dad’s, way before the facility came. He owns Zamboni’s Pizzeria. He’s a warm person.
