# Claire Brielle Mont-Blanc

The Mont-Blanc's have a strange habit of continuing the family legacy through adoption. Claire was one such adoption but she was already an 18-year-old when she joined the Mont-Blanc family.

The Mont-Blanc is an eclectic family dabbling in a lot of things and Claire just happened to be interested in the mystic. She studied with one of the dilettantes in the family and in the blink of an eye, a decade has passed.

At the age of twenty, Anastasia was placed under Claire's care. Two years later, Claire and Anastasia moved to Beacon Hills for a short five years to monitor a magic tree there that has been tampered with for one reason or another.

Afterwards, Claire and Anastasia moved to Perth, Australia. She set up a new age shop, Smoke and Incense. She has fortune telling services in her shop but for the most part, she sells potpourri sachets, tools to dabble in witchcraft and some pottery from local artisans. Others who know about the Mont-Blanc name will visit the shop for more… interesting services.

Dahlia joins the shop in the third year that Claire has stayed there.
