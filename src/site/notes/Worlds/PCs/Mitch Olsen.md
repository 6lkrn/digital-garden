|Description|
|A regular road racer that specializes in the mountain race. Was made to join the cycling club with a friend a few years ago, turns out he has the affinity for cycling with his unusual cadence in his ride. He has shoulder length black hair and used to wear glasses but ditched them for contact lenses because they are annoying when he goes riding on his road racer. <br><br>  <br><br>Personality wise, he’s confident in his skills when he’s on a race and takes instructions from his coach very seriously (that he must uphold no matter what, will never disobey). Shy with new people around but will warm up with them afterwards and have no problem striking up conversations with them. Outside of racing he can get panicky Easily because he can get a little clumsy at times. <br><br>  <br><br>As for his secret that his rival knows… he’s a nerd when it comes to comic books and loves reading comic books in his free time.<br><br>  <br><br>Other details include being half asian (Mom’s Japanese). Parents met in Japan, married in wherever they are now lmao so she’s a very Japanesey person. And dk what happens most of the time lmao|
