Naenia Dea

  

She can't really be in hell. She's a devoted cleric of Geyiğî. There must be some kind of misunderstanding with the higher powers. After all, she remembered something about being named after a goddess.

Of Geyiğî the separator

The minor deity Geyiğî the separator is connected to lush forests and its inhabitants. This deity, who comes to the mortal realm in the form of a monstrous deer, guards forests. They guide lost people or make them get lost, depending on their attitude in the forest. 

Geyiğî protects the inhabitants of the forest from the darkness from outside and protects the inhabitants out of the forest from the darkness in the forest.

This deity is said to be associated with a certain goddess of funerals. 

Geyiğî the separator’s followers

The holy symbol of the deity comes in the form of an eyeless deer skull with carvings. Some followers may wear it as jewellery, drawn on weapons and armour or even making helms out of real deer skulls.
