The Holy [[Worlds/Barovia/Locations/Church of Barovia\|Church of Barovia]] of the Sun preaches that the Emperor is a direct descendant of the Sun god and therefore has the only legitimate claim to the throne of the planet. This is a lie fabricated 300 years ago and the [[Worlds/Barovia/Locations/Church of Barovia\|Church of Barovia]] doggedly preaches it while stamping out any alternate schools of thought. The Church religiously burns any historical texts that counter their teachings and destroy all religions except for their own. Their sole goal is to spread the hold light of the sun to all corners of the planet. The Nobles donate to them generously as a show of their wealth, prosperity and humbleness. The Church in return supports their claims to nobility and power.

The Church is riddled with infighting and faction-hood. The position of the head is held by a weak bootlicker that scrambles to fulfil the Emperorâ€™s every demand. None of the other big priests support their cowardly leader and instead spend their every moment politicking and scrambling for power and influence in the hopes that they will one day become the next head and gain the ear of the Emperor.
