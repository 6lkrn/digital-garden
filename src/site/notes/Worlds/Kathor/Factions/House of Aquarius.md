The House of Aquarius (ofttimes called the [[Worlds/Kathor/Factions/Ampora family\|Ampora family]] by land-dwellers) is a longstanding orphaner pod in the [[Altennyaath\|Altennyaath]] tribe of [_Sirenia orcinus_](https://talesofrelea.fandom.com/wiki/Sirens#Sirenia_orcinus "Sirens"). It currently consists of four members.

## History

Ever since Her Radiance [[Feferi Peixes\|Feferi Peixes]]' successful coup against the tyrant [[Condie Peixes\|Condie Peixes]], a period of peace graces the war-torn region as Her Imperious Condescension's insatiable bloodlust and imperialism is finally brought to an end. Combined with the house's second-born's great achievement, the new prime matriarch has deemed it fit to give the House of Aquarius leeway in their bodyguard duties. This allowed them to pursue basal hobbies, such as fine arts, magical studies, amassing naval fleets, and historical preservation.

## Members

### "Orphaner Dualscar"

The current matriarch of the house. None but his closest associates know his true name: the most laymen know is his last name is Ampora. Probably.

Alongside general household management, Dualscar also handles a bulk of the family's naval fleet.

### [[Cronus Ampora\|Cronus Ampora]]

Firstborn of the Orphaner. Unlike the rest of his family, he never dipped his toes in militant matters: instead, he dedicates his life's work to pursuit of the arts. When the halls of the house's abode echoes with beautiful melody, more often than not, it is him at the source.

### [[Eridan Ampora\|Eridan Ampora]]

Second-born of the Orphaner. He managed the naval fleet alongside Dualscar, earning the intriguing moniker _Commodore Heartbreaker_, but has since stepped down, leaving its management to the matriarch and youngest-born. Nowadays, he spends his time in the house's ever-expanding library, collecting and recording whatever he can of the Altennyaath's history. He can also be found studying the mined crystals--and magic, in general--in his study.

### [[Crys Ampora\|Crys Ampora]]

Youngest-born of the Orphaner. As the runt of the litter, he has yet to settle into a niche, dipping his toes into everything: he has a hand in managing the naval fleets; his body moves as gracefully as kelp in the ocean currents, in dance and in combat; and his constant gallivanting around the seas means he acts as Eridan's eyes and ears---and hands, should he find anything physical.

Curiously, he is the only one with a spouse: some random guy--human, to boot--named [[Nova Captor\|Nova Captor]]. Rumours abound as to how and why they are together.
