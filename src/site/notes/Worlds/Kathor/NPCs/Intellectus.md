Lives on [[Worlds/Kathor/Locations/Dog Island\|Dog Island]]

S of [[Worlds/Kathor/NPCs/Pochi\|Pochi]].

After [[Worlds/Kathor/NPCs/Pochi\|Pochi]] died, he was left in control of the sailors and a few of  their soldiers from the old gang. 

He promised to support the crew as long as they took him with them and helped him fulfil his dream of chasing the [[Worlds/Kathor/Locations/Everstorm\|Everstorm]]. The crew promised her [[Worlds/PCs/Alpha\|Alpha]]'s mansion.

The crew brought him along with them on the ship he had built. They planned to assault the main island and the navy stationed there.

[[Worlds/Kathor/NPCs/June\|June]] and [[Worlds/Kathor/NPCs/Intellectus\|Intellectus]] sailed east around the island while the crew sailed west. They were intercepted by [[Worlds/Dard\|Dard]] and [[Worlds/Kathor/NPCs/Deagle\|Deagle]].

The crew saved [[Worlds/Kathor/NPCs/Intellectus\|Intellectus]] and managed to get [[Worlds/Kathor/NPCs/June\|June]] to take the blame for their rebellion instead.
