[[_Ongoing Campaign/20. One Piece/20. One Piece\|20. One Piece]]

Sir Thursday isn't handsome, charismatic or powerful like the other nobles. He looks quite ordinary, but he is extraordinarily strong and talented. He always wears a simple metal breastplate with no medals or decorations. A simple minded and yet hard working soldier he is fiercely loyal to the throne. Due to the king's inactiveness, he too has been stuck at the capital with his army, unable to act despite the wishes and demands of the princes and the queen. Despite his good features, he can have a cruel streak, prone to beating or executing any subordinates that fail and has shown to be prone to violent fits.
