Lives on [[Worlds/Kathor/Locations/Dog Island\|Dog Island]]

Girlfriend of [[Worlds/Kathor/NPCs/Pochi\|Pochi]].

After [[Worlds/Kathor/NPCs/Pochi\|Pochi]] died, she seized control of around 1/3 of hid old gang. 

She promised to support the crew as long as they got her a house on the main island. The crew promised her [[Worlds/PCs/Alpha\|Alpha]]'s mansion.

The crew brought her along with them on a ship of her own. They planned to assault the main island and the navy stationed there.

June and [[Worlds/Kathor/NPCs/Intellectus\|Intellectus]] sailed east around the island while the crew sailed west. They were intercepted by [[Worlds/Dard\|Dard]] and [[Worlds/Kathor/NPCs/Deagle\|Deagle]].

The crew sold her out and the rebellion on [[Worlds/Kathor/Locations/Dog Island\|Dog Island]] was blamed on her instead of [[Worlds/Kathor/NPCs/Scruffy\|Scruffy]] and [[Worlds/Kathor/NPCs/Intellectus\|Intellectus]].
