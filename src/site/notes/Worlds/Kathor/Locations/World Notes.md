Setting

The planet of [[Worlds/Kathor/Kathor\|Kathor]] is a massive archipelago. The setting is the age of sails/victorian era.

The magic on the planet is fueled by magical Crystals and mages create massive sailing ships and other machines with these crystals, the crystals are a rare resource.

There are european-inspired empires that need them to run their ships and war machines.

Eventually a surveyor finds a deep and extensive deposit of magical crystals on a stretch of unexplored islands. The natives of these islands are not as technologically advanced and have not yet been colonised.

The various Empires want to colonise it and farm the crystals for their own ends, but they want to avoid a war over it since the balance of power is very delicate.

Many of these empires are overstretched and exhausted of resources due to their seemingly infinite desire for war and conquest.

A treaty is created where the empires decide to join together and set up the Exploration and Extraction Trade Company aka "[[Worlds/Kathor/Factions/The Company\|The Company]]".

Greedy minor nobles and merchants are allowed to purchase plots of land and mine the crystals as long as [[Worlds/Kathor/Factions/The Company\|The Company]] receives their share of the produce. The 

Company uses this money to raise a private navy that they use to control and colonise the islands.

Soon people flood to the islands for jobs, opportunities and adventure and a massive trade economy is set up. The blooming trade brings pirates.

You play as one of these individuals.You explore islands that are off the maps, deal with the various factions that inhabit them and experience many adventures all in the desire for wealth, fame and glory.

The main factions are

[[Worlds/Kathor/Factions/The Company\|The Company]]

# Campaign

You create a semi-complete family tree. Doesn't have to be extensive but has to have all the active members of the family. And by active I mean the ones that are present or have the potential to be present. Estate. Your family will have an estate that they manage. The estate consists of a source of income, investments, vassals that do your dirty work, buildings, political connections and other resources. You will be able to manage your estate and will be presented with in game events that serve as opportunities and threats. How you deal with them will influence your family, bringing either fame or dishonour. The Two Faces of Society. While, you are members of the same society and will often rub shoulders, you will also be competing for success. This means backstabbing, intrigue and Murder will be just as common as alliances, joint business ventures and romances. If your character dies you are able to control another character from your family, you can even create a new character and pass them off as a distant relative. BUT If your estate and house fall into ruin you will be forced to abandon your beloved noble family and create a new one.
# Factions

## [[Worlds/Kathor/Factions/The Company\|The Company]]

[[Worlds/Kathor/Factions/The Company\|The Company]] is the strongest faction on the islands.

They started off as a small group of merchants that bought the contract to colonise the islands but they have slowly grown to be one of the strongest factions in the empire. The land they had purchased from the empire had seemed inconsequential at first, until the empire learned about the crystals that lay below the wild islands.

As they control the supply of all crystals from the unexplored islands, they have a lot of influence. This influence has only grown as the empire's other sources of crystals diminish.  
  
The emperor is concerned with how strong [[Worlds/Kathor/Factions/The Company\|The Company]] has gotten and the imperial court is watching their every move very closely. Even a sign of weakness would give the empire reason to step in and finally take control of the coveted crystal mines.

[[Worlds/Kathor/Factions/The Company\|The Company]] does very little of the mining itself, preferring to allow minor merchants and nobles to do all the dirty work. Instead they focus their resources on building up their powerful navy and gaining and training valuable “agents”.

Company men are taught to train [[Worlds/Kathor/Factions/The Company\|The Company]] as Family and are ingrained into the culture from a young age. These men go on to retire with hefty pensions and land grants on the islands. Even in retirement these men do [[Worlds/Kathor/Factions/The Company\|The Company]]’s bidding, the wealth they had gained in [[Worlds/Kathor/Factions/The Company\|The Company]]'s employ providing them with the means to enter high society. The retired sailors and foot soldiers provide a trained and loyal force that live upon the colonised island and are able to be called up at a moment's notice.

[[Worlds/Kathor/Factions/The Company\|The Company]] has been slowly gaining influence and control over the nobles and merchants of the empire. They control much of the trade in the empire and have a navy that rivals the imperial navy. 

The true owner of [[Worlds/Kathor/Factions/The Company\|The Company]] and their end goals are still unknown. 

## The Imperial Court

The emperor is the descendant of a recent warlord that conquered much of the known world. The conqueror dealt with the new lands by incorporating the conquered nobility into their own empire. Allowing them to keep their titles and lands kept the nobles loyal to their new emperor. The nobles help enforce the empire's rule over the many peoples and lands throughout the planet. In return for this, they enjoy a luxurious lifestyle that most people can only dream of. 

The Emperor requires that one member of each noble family be present in the capital city, under the Emperor’s control. This person helps represent their family’s interests while also serving as a hostage to keep the nobles in check. The Empire has spent almost 500 years in constant warfare, leading to them running out of manpower and resources and being forced to turn over a lot of power to the nobles and [[Worlds/Kathor/Factions/The Company\|The Company]]. 

The Court is made up of the Imperial family and its branches. All important family members have important positions in the branches of government. The structure of the government ensures that the imperial family holds a tight control over the core functions of the Empire. Unfortunately the nepotism has slowly lead to the growth of corruption and incompetence. 

The Emperor wants to restore absolute power though he must be careful not to upset the delicate balance.

## The Clergy

The Holy [[Worlds/Kathor/Factions/Church of the Sun\|Church of the Sun]] preaches that the Emperor is a direct descendant of the Sun god and therefore has the only legitimate claim to the throne of the planet. This is a lie fabricated 300 years ago and the church doggedly preaches it while stamping out any alternate schools of thought. The Church religiously burns any historical texts that counter their teachings and destroy all religions except for their own. Their sole goal is to spread the hold light of the sun to all corners of the planet. The Nobles donate to them generously as a show of their wealth, prosperity and humbleness. The Church in return supports their claims to nobility and power. 

The Church is riddled with infighting and faction-hood. The position of the head is held by a weak bootlicker that scrambles to fulfil the Emperor’s every demand. None of the other big priests support their cowardly leader and instead spend their every moment politicking and scrambling for power and influence in the hopes that they will one day become the next head and gain the ear of the Emperor.

## The Pirates

The Pirates are a motley and unruly group of criminals that inhabit the seas of the entire planet. Their greatest concentration is in the unexplored islands.  
## The Natives

There are many tribes of natives on the unexplored islands. These other races such as merfolk and birdfolk.

The tribes often are matriarchal and follow a female elder.

Size: Count the number of hexes your estate comprises and record that number here. This number affects a estate’sConsumption and its Control DC.

  

Control DC: A estate’s Control DC is 20 + its size; this value is the DC you’ll be rolling against most often with your estate’s Stability, Economy, and Loyalty checks.

  

Population: Actual population numbers do not factor into your estate’s statistics, but it can be fun to track the number anyway. An estate’s population is equal to its size × 250 + the total population of each of its cities.

  

Stability, Economy, and Loyalty: These three values are analogous to saving throws. You make Stability checks during an estate’s Upkeep phase to determine whether it remains secure. You make Economy checks during an estate's Income phase to determine how much its treasury increases. You make Loyalty checks to keep the public peace. An estate's initial scores in all three of these categories is 0. A natural 1 is always a failure for these checks, and a natural 20 is always a success.

  

Unrest: A estate’s Unrest value indicates how rebellious its people are. A estate’s Unrest score is applied as a penalty on all Stability, Economy, and Loyalty checks. If an estate's Unrest is above 10, it begins to lose control of hexes it has claimed. If an estate's Unrest score ever reaches 20, it falls into anarchy. While in anarchy, an estate can take no action and treats all Stability, Economy, and Loyalty check results as 0. Restoring order once an estate falls into anarchy typically requires a number of quests and lengthy adventures. Unrest can never go below 0—adjustments that would normally reduce Unrest lower than 0 are wasted.

  

Consumption: A estate’s prosperity is measured by the Build Points (abbreviated BP) in its treasury, and its Consumption indicates how many BP it costs to keep the estate functioning. If an estate is unable to pay its Consumption, its Unrest increases by 2. A estate’s Consumption is equal to its size plus the number of city districts it contains plus adjustments for Edicts minus 2 per farmland.

  

Treasury: As your estate earns money, favours, resources, and power, its Build Point total increases. You begin with 50 BP in your estate’s treasury.

  

Special Resources: If your estate includes any special resources (see below), record them here. 

  

Leadership: Write in the names of the PCs or NPCs filling each of the 11 leadership roles here, along with their appropriate modifiers.

Edicts

Edicts (promotions, taxes, and festivals) increase your estate’s Stability, Economy, and Loyalty scores. 

Promotions can include recruitments, advertisements, and even propaganda [[Campaigns/Campaigns\|Campaigns]]. Taxes are payments gathered from an estate's citizens to help pay for Consumption.

Festivals, which can also include parades and other public events, can increase the estate’s happiness and loyalty. 

  

Resources: Resources include particularly valuable sources of lumber, metal, gems, food, or the like. A resource hex increases an estate's Economy by 1.

  

Leadership roles

A healthy Settlement has leaders filling a number of different roles. Each leader grants different benefits; leaving a role unfilled can penalise the settlement.

In order for a Leadership role to grant its bonus, the character in that particular role must spend at least 1 week per month engaged in various leadership duties. A single character can only occupy one leadership role at a time.

  

Mayor

Bounty Hunter

Benefit: Increase Loyalty by a value equal to the Bounty Hunter’s Strength or Dexterity modifier. Fear inspired by the Bounty Hunter reduces Unrest by 1 during each Upkeep phase.

Vacancy Penalty: A settlement without a Bounty Hunter suffers no vacancy penalty.

  

Spymaster

The Spymaster observes the settlement’s underworld and criminal elements and spies on other factions.

Benefit: Increase Loyalty, Economy, or Stability (Spymaster’s choice) by a value equal to the Spymaster’s Dexterity or Intelligence modifier. The Spymaster can change which value he modifies during the settlement’s Improvement phase (but only once per phase).

# Short Stories

## Oceanographer’s Tale

My name is Jonathan O’Connell Dougherty. I am currently 78 years old… old enough to be anyone’s grandfather. Except that I am not one. For my entire life, I had been sailing the entire world for the Empire, under the Queen’s Order of Explorations, for my entire life has been decidedly dedicated to the Queen. I am what others called the Master Sailor, and my job extends, quite literally, to all things being the ocean. The Queen’s Order is my wife, my life, and the ocean my mistress. As a married man would do, he would seek out any reasons to be with his mistress, and so I did too. 

The Order of Explorations began in the year 1056, during the 50th year of the Empire’s rise to the top of the world’s food chain. We dominated everything, we were prosperous, all thanks to this magnificent mineral, simply called the Crystal. This bright and shimmering stone contains the single largest source of power ever known to mankind. The discovery of the Crystal occurred when our Queen, our Saviour, dug out the foundations to the Great Bridge to lead her people out of the diseased Eastern Worlds. While shovelling mud and stones from the soil, she struck a piece of the Crystal from the ground, and while it was not buried as deep as it looked like it should, the blue glitter mesmerised our Queen. 

- Find out a way to describe the first real application of the crystal
    

And so, our people harvested the Crystal and used it to conjure up the Great Bridge, allowing our people to flee to safety on the West Worlds. 

But us as humans, mere mortals, we were always plagued with a deep void within us, always searching, always hungry, always looking for the grandiose brought upon by the neverending achievements our Empire brings. We as the citizens of our Queen’s Empire, standing tall and proud, waving our flags wherever we go. We conquered lands and seas alike, in search for even more Crystal. 

Although one palm-sized Crystal could sustain and power the entire city for the entire solar rotation, our Empire grew so enormous, a mere chunk of this magical stone simply grew to be insufficient for the conquest.
