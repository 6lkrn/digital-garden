“There are greater evils in the many realms I’m privy to then you can comprehend. Evils that would make *me* look like a Respectable Gentleman. I eventually found my place in the grand scheme of things. I am a *prisoner* in [[Worlds/Barovia/Locations/Barovia\|Barovia]], yes, but I’m also its *warden.*” -- Strahd von Zarcovish, Lord of Ravenloft

“I assure you, mortal: If you ever see me, someone Facked up!” -- Strahd

“Take me from me, the Dread Lord of Ravenloft, the most powerful Vampire you’ll ever survive meeting: **We Do Not Sparkle!** Me, Vlad Tepes, and Sorrin Markov teamed up to hunt this Stephanie Meyer down, and we all placed bets on what kind of punishment to give her for that crap bomb of a book. Vlad won. What he reduced her to gives *me* nightmares.” -- Strahd

I don’t play much into cosmology in my campaign settings, preferring to limit my campaign setting down to one plane or even a part of a plane and then branching out when I have the need. If I involve any other plane, it’s for a good reason.

And no better reason for adding a plane than when someone crosses the Moral Event Horizon. I have a [[Worlds/Barovia/Factions/Dark Powers\|Dark Powers]] mechanic that will eventually summon the Mist of Ravenloft to snatch the offending character away to his Demiplane. If he’s lucky. If he’s not, he’ll have the Lord of Ravenloft grab him by the scuff of the neck and drag him there personally!

In the future, I’ll explain Strahd’s role in my campaign world in a better light, especially when *Curse of Strahd: Tatyanna’s Revenge* comes into play. But for now, here’s the TL;DR version: One, Strahd is both Prisoner and Warden in [[Worlds/Barovia/Locations/Barovia\|Barovia]], which is a buffer plane between this realm—and in fact all of my campaign settings—and the many demiplanes with Dread Lords *even worse* than he is. Two: When the Mists cover a region, that region occupies both its main world and [[Worlds/Barovia/Locations/Barovia\|Barovia]]. Therefore, Strahd can appear in this Mist-covered region and interact with the party as long as the mist exists. This is how he’ll grab someone who’s been a bad boy. This will come into play in my rendition of *The [[Worlds/Barovia/Locations/Sunless Citadel\|Sunless Citadel]].* Also, Three: My version of Strahd is inspired by not just classic vampire movies, but also series where the vampire had a sympathetic side, such as *Angel*, *Forever Knight*, *Moonlight*, and other shows with a heroic sociopath such as *Dexter*. The result is a Count Stahd who will play the Devil very well, and enjoy doing so, but would have a side of him that, when the party finds it, would give them pause before driving that stake into his heart.


# **Rundown:** 

Son of [[Worlds/Barovia/NPCs/Queen Ravenovia\|Queen Ravenovia]] van Roeyen and King Barov
Brother of [[Worlds/Barovia/NPCs/Sergei von Zarovich\|Sergei]]

Strahd von Zarovich, a vampire and wizard, has the statistics presented in appendix D. Although he can be encountered almost anywhere in his domain, the vampire is always encountered in the place indicated by the card reading later in this chapter, unless he has been forced into his tomb in the catacombs of Castle Ravenloft.
# **Description:**
Strahd believes his soul is lost to evil. He feels neither pity nor remorse, neither love nor hate. He doesn't suffer anguish or wallow in indignation. He believes, and has always believed, that he is the master of his own fate. When he was alive, Strahd could admit to letting his emotions get the better of him from time to time. Now, as a vampire, he is more monster than man, with barely a hint of emotion left. He is above the concerns of the living. The only event that occasionally haunts him is the death of [[Worlds/Barovia/NPCs/Tatyana Ivanova\|Tatyana]], but his view of the past is bereft of romance or regret. In his mind, her death couldn't have been prevented, and what is done cannot be undone. In life, Strahd lived to conquer. In undeath, he conquers still-not realms, but people, driving good souls to become corrupt and destroying those who won't yield. Characters who try to appeal to Strahd's humanity will be gravely disappointed, because there is little humanity left in him. If they ask Strahd why he's preying on Ireena Kolyana, he tells them that Ireena's body is the host for [[Worlds/Barovia/NPCs/Tatyana Ivanova\|Tatyana]]'s soul, and [[Worlds/Barovia/NPCs/Tatyana Ivanova\|Tatyana]]'s soul belongs to him. Strahd can be seductive and subtle when he chooses to be, especially if a person is clever or attractive. Men and women of beauty and cunning amuse Strahd for a time-playthings to possess or discard as he desires. If he senses a lack of cohesion in a party of adventurers, he preys on that weakness and tries to drive a wedge between the characters by promising to help one at the expense of another. If Strahd senses evil in a person, he cultivates that tendency by offering to turn that character into a full-fledged vampire after helping Strahd destroy the rest of the party. Ultimately, Strahd doesn't honor his promise, instead turning the character into a vampire spawn under his control.

# **Character History:**
In life, Strahd von Zarovich was a count, a prince, a soldier, and a conqueror. After the death of bis father, King Barov, Strahd waged long, bloody wars against his family's enemies. He and his army cornered the last of these enemies in a remote mountain valley before slaying them all. Strahd named the valley Barovia, after his deceased father, and was so struck by its scenic beauty that he decided to settle there. [[Worlds/Barovia/NPCs/Queen Ravenovia\|Queen Ravenovia]] lamented the death of Barov and was fearful of Strahd. War had made him cold and arrogant. She kept her younger son, [[Worlds/Barovia/NPCs/Sergei von Zarovich\|Sergei]], away from the battlefield. Strahd envied the love and attention his mother visited upon his brother, so in Barovia he remained. Peace made Strahd restless, and he began to feel like his best years were behind him.
<blockquote></Strong>

I AM THE ANCIENT. I AM THE LAND.<p>My beginnings are lost in the darkness of the past.</p>
I am not dead. <p>Nor am I alive.</p><p> I am undead, forever. </p><Strong>[[Resources/Equipment/Books, Texts/Tome of Strahd\|Tome of Strahd]]</Strong>

Unwilling to go the way of his father, Strahd studied magic and forged a pact with the Dark Powers of the Shadowfell in return for the promise of immortality. Strahd scoured his conquered lands for wizards and artisans, brought them to the valley of Barovia, and commanded them to raise a castle to rival the magnificent fortresses of his ancestral homeland. Strahd named the castle Ravenloft, after his mother, to demonstrate his Jove for her. When it was complete, Strahd commanded his mother and brother to come to Barovia and stay with him. [[Worlds/Barovia/NPCs/Sergei von Zarovich\|Sergei]] eventually took up residence at Raveoloft, but Ravenovia passed away while traveling to her namesake. In sorrowful disappointment, Strahd sealed his mother's body in a crypt beneath the castle. Strahd's attention soon turned to [[Worlds/Barovia/NPCs/Tatyana Ivanova\|Tatyana]], a young Barovian woman of fine lineage and remarkable beauty. Strahd believed her to be a worthy bride, and he lavished [[Worlds/Barovia/NPCs/Tatyana Ivanova\|Tatyana]] with gifts and attention. Despite Strahd's efforts, she instead fell in love with the younger, warmer [[Worlds/Barovia/NPCs/Sergei von Zarovich\|Sergei]]. Strahd's pride prevented him from standing in the way of the young couple's love until the day of [[Worlds/Barovia/NPCs/Sergei von Zarovich\|Sergei]] and [[Worlds/Barovia/NPCs/Tatyana Ivanova\|Tatyana]]'s wedding, when Strahd gazed into a mirror and realized he had been a fool. Strahd murdered [[Worlds/Barovia/NPCs/Sergei von Zarovich\|Sergei]] and drank his blood, sealing the evil pact between Strahd and the Dark Powers. He then chased [[Worlds/Barovia/NPCs/Sergei von Zarovich\|Sergei]]'s bride-to-be through the gardens, determined to make her accept and love him. [[Worlds/Barovia/NPCs/Tatyana Ivanova\|Tatyana]] hurled herself off a castle balcony to escape Strahd's pursuit, plunging to her death. Treacherous castle guards, seizing the opportunity to rid the world of Strahd forever, shot their master with arrows. But Strahd did not die. The [[Worlds/Barovia/Factions/Dark Powers\|Dark Powers]] honored the pact they had made. The sky went black as Strahd turned on the guards, his eyes blazing red. He had become a vampire. After slaughtering the guards, Strahd saw the faces of his father and mother in the thunderclouds, looking down upon him and judging him. He had destroyed the family bloodline and doomed all of [[Worlds/Barovia/Locations/Barovia\|Barovia]]. The castle and the valley were spirited away, locked in a demiplane surrounded on all sides by deadly fog. For Strahd and his people, there would be no escape.

Strahd has been the master of Ravenloft for centuries now. Since becoming a vampire, he has taken several consorts-none as beloved as [[Worlds/Barovia/NPCs/Tatyana Ivanova\|Tatyana Ivanova]], but each a person of beauty. All of them he turned into vampire spawn. Although he feeds on the hapless souls of Barovia, they provide little nourishment and no comfort. From time to time, strangers from faraway lands are brought to his domain, to play the vampire's game of cat-and-mouse. Strahd savors these moments, for though these strangers offer him no lands to conquer, they aren't so easily destroyed and therefore provide a welcome diversion. Strahd believes that the key to his escaping Barovia lies in finding someone worthy to rule in his stead, but his arrogance are so indomitable that no one is ever good enough in his eyes. He believes in his cold heart that only a von Zarovich as great as he or his father could sway the [[Worlds/Barovia/Factions/Dark Powers\|Dark Powers]] to release him..

# **Goals:**
Strahd has the following goals in the adventure. 
###### TURN IREENA KOLYANA 
Strahd's unrequited love for [[Worlds/Barovia/NPCs/Tatyana Ivanova\|Tatyana Ivanova]] drove him to slay his brother, [[Worlds/Barovia/NPCs/Sergei von Zarovich\|Sergei von Zarovich]]. Some time ago, Strahd glimpsed the young woman [[Worlds/Barovia/NPCs/Ireena Kolyana\|Ireena Kolyana]] in the village of Barovia and felt extreme deja vu. Ireena looked exactly like [[Worlds/Barovia/NPCs/Tatyana Ivanova\|Tatyana]]! Strahd now believes that Ireena is the latest reincarnation of [[Worlds/Barovia/NPCs/Tatyana Ivanova\|Tatyana]], and thus he seeks to claim her. Strahd's evil courtship has led him to visit Ireena twice. On both occasions, he charmed his way into her home-the house of her adopted father, the burgomaster of the village of Barovia-and drank her blood. He intends to kill Ireena during their next meeting and turn her into his vampire spawn consort. Chapter 3 gives details about Ireena and where to find her in the village of Barovia. 

###### FIND RUDOLPH VAN RIGHTEN 
Although he is usually focused on making [[Worlds/Barovia/NPCs/Ireena Kolyana\|Ireena Kolyana]] his bride, Strahd has been distracted by reports that a legendary vampire hunter named [[Worlds/Barovia/NPCs/Rudolph Van Richten\|Rudolph Van Richten]] has come to [[Worlds/Barovia/Locations/Barovia\|Barovia]]. It takes more than one old man with a death wish to frighten Strahd; nevertheless, the vampire has his spies searching [[Worlds/Barovia/Locations/Barovia\|Barovia]] for van Richten. Strahd would like very much to meet the old vampire hunter, lock him in the dungeons of [[Worlds/Barovia/Locations/Castle Ravenloft\|Castle Ravenloft]], and slowly break his spirit. Chapter 5 describes the town of Vallaki, where van Richten currently resides incognito. 

###### SEARCH FOR A SUCCESSOR OR CONSORT
Strahd can sense the a:rrival of new blood in his domain. When newcomers enter [[Worlds/Barovia/Locations/Barovia\|Barovia]], he shifts his attention from [[Worlds/Barovia/NPCs/Ireena Kolyana\|Ireena Kolyana]] and Van Richten to his new guests so that he can determine whether any of them is worthy to be his successor or consort. (Eventually, he decides that none of them can replace him as master of Barovia, but he doesn't arrive at this conclusion immediately.) 
Stra·hd pays close attention to adventurers who are charismatic and arrogant, like himself. He focuses his attacks on them, to see how much they can withstand. If they crumble easily, he loses interest in them. If they exhibit great fortitude and defiance, his interest is piqued-even more so if the character displays uncommon knowledge or beauty. Such a person might not be worthy to succeed him, but the man or woman might provide amusement to Strahd as a new possession.

# **When to Attack:**
 ### When Strahd Attacks
Strahd isn't a villain who remains out of sight until the final scene. Far from it-he travels as he desires to any place in his realm or his castle, and (from his perspective) the more often he encounters the characters, the better. The characters can and should meet him multiple times before the final encounter, which most likely takes place in the location determined by the card reading. When Strahd wants to terrorize the characters, he pays them a visit, either  under the cloak of night or beneath overcast skies during the day. If they're indoors, he tries to charm or goad a character into inviting him inside (along with his vampire spawn; if they are present). Strahd and his minions never attack Ireena. These encounters are meant to test the characters, not kill them. After a few rounds of toying with them, Strahd and his creatures withdraw. If the characters retreat, Strahd is likely to allow them to flee, savoring their fear and believing he has broken them.

# **Tactics:**

Strahd’s Tactics 

Even in combat, Strahd is no ordinary foe. Like several of the enemies encountered in this adventure, he uses a multi phase statblock in battle. Strahd’s statistics work as follows: 

Phases 

Strahd's combat statistics include three phases: the Mage, the Soldier, and the Vampire. Each phase has its own unique features, abilities, and an independent pool of hit points. 

(For example, damage dealt to the Soldier phase doesn’t carry over to the Mage phase.) 

Strahd can choose which phase he begins in when rolling initiative. By default, his starting phase is the Mage. 

When outside of combat, Strahd can: 

switch into his Solder phase by drawing his longsword and extinguishing his focus; switch into his Mage phase by lighting his focus (his cloak's ruby clasp) and stowing his longsword; switch into his Vampire phase by stowing his longsword and extinguishing his focus. 

Phase Transitions 

When a phase is reduced to 0 hit points, Strahd’s statistics are immediately replaced by the statistics of another phase (your choice). When this happens, all conditions afflicting Strahd end. (For example, if Strahd was prone or paralyzed, he is no longer prone or paralyzed.) Damage dealt to one phase does not carry over to the next. 

By default, Strahd's second phase is the Soldier, and his third phase is the Vampire. When Strahd enters his second phase, his eyes glow crimson red and his fingernails lengthen and harden. When Strahd enters his third phase, his fangs grow longer and sharper, and his nostrils become batlike slits. 

A phase reduced to 0 hit points can’t be used again until Strahd completes a long rest in his coffin. 

Defeat 

If all three phases are reduced to 0 hit points, Strahd transforms into a cloud of mist instead of falling unconscious, provided that he isn't in running water or sunlight. If he can't transform, he is destroyed. 


The Power Source. Strahd’s plan requires a substantial amount of power—far more than he can supply himself. So long as he remains bonded to the Fanes of Barovia, however, he can channel their power directly into the Heart of Sorrow for use in the ritual. 

Using the Fanes in the ritual will also allow Strahd to bring the valley itself—and all of its inhabitants—along with him to the Material Plane. Given that Barovia was his final conquest and the centerpiece of his power, Strahd will not relinquish it so easily. 

The Control Mechanism. The raw power of the leylines beneath the Fanes is wild and near-impossible to control. Even as their master, only a token of the Ladies’ divinity can allow Strahd to direct them. He has recently learned that a child with the blood of the Seeker resides somewhere within the valley—the Vistana Arabelle, though Strahd does not yet know her name—and has directed his spies to locate and capture her. 

Should this plot fail, Strahd must instead journey to the Whispering Wall at Yester Hill and make a sacrifice of great personal value—his animated armor, the symbol of his early conquests and might—exchanging a piece of his past for a promise of his future. 

The Catalyst. Power and control are all well and good. In order to break through a wall, however, all good conquerors need a point of attack. To this end, Strahd plans to forge a battering ram capable of piercing through the Mists—a siege weapon forged from the souls of the Barovians themselves. 

The Mists, as creations of the Dark Powers, are born of apathy, fear, and despair. To escape the Mists without drawing their ire, therefore, Strahd intends to surround the Heart of Sorrow with a shell of wailing, hopeless souls. He believes that, by brutally reasserting his dominion over Barovia, his subjects will lose themselves to fear and despair, darkening their souls to meet his needs. 

By consuming the Barovians’ souls, Strahd can also use the energies of his escape to repurpose their soulless husks as undead soldiers, forging a new army for his conquests to come. The sole exceptions include Ireena Kolyana and Dr. Rudolph van Richten, who Strahd will allow to keep their souls for his own purposes. 

Plans Within Plans. If the players reconsecrate the Fanes, Strahd quickly devises a backup plan. By becoming the champions of the Fanes, the players will unknowingly have made themselves into conduits for their power, allowing Strahd to access the Fanes’ energies if he can lure the players to Castle Ravenloft. 

He can do this by using the power stored in the Heart of Sorrow to plunge Barovia into eternal night, raising the deceased from their graves and sending a plague of undead against Barovia’s settlements—a siege that will end only if Strahd himself is defeated. As a bonus, Strahd believes that this undead apocalypse will surely drive the Barovians into fear and despair, counteracting the players' efforts to bring hope to the valley. 

Strahd’s Allies 

Strahd commands a vast host of beasts, undead, and other minions, which he can direct in a host of plots or schemes. They include: 

[[Worlds/Barovia/NPCs/Rahadin\|Rahadin]], Strahd’s dusk elf chamberlain   

While transformed in this way, he has a fly speed of 30 feet, can hover, and has immunity to all damage, except the damage he takes from sunlight. He must reach his coffin within 2 hours or be destroyed. Once in his coffin, he reverts to his vampire form. He is then paralyzed until he regains at least 1 hit point. After 1 hour in his coffin with 0 hit points, he regains 1 hit point. 

Attributes & Weaknesses 

All three phases share the following vampire attributes and weaknesses: 

Undead Nature. Strahd doesn't require air. 

Forbiddance. Strahd can't enter a residence without an invitation from one of the occupants. 

Chained to the Grave. Strahd cannot gain the benefits of a long rest except by resting in his coffin for eight consecutive hours between dawn and dusk. 

Children of the Night. Strahd can comprehend and verbally communicate with Barovian bats, rats, and wolves (including dire wolves), which obey his commands. 

Stake to the Heart. If a piercing weapon made of wood is driven into Strahd’s heart while he is incapacitated in his coffin, he is paralyzed until the stake is removed. 

Additionally, Strahd can use the following action in his Vampire form: 

Shapechange. If Strahd isn't in running water or sunlight, he polymorphs into a Tiny bat, a Medium wolf, or a Medium cloud of mist, or back into his true form. His statistics, other than his size and speed, are unchanged. Anything he is wearing transforms with him, but nothing he is carrying does. He reverts to his true form if he dies. While in mist form, Strahd can't take any actions, speak, or manipulate objects. He is weightless, has a flying speed of 20 feet, can hover, and can enter a hostile creature's space and stop there. In addition, if air can pass through a space, the mist can do so without squeezing, and he can't pass through water. He has advantage on Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution saving throws, and he is immune to all nonmagical damage, except the damage he takes from sunlight. 

While Strahd retains a connection to the Fanes of Barovia, he also possesses the following features in all three phases: 

Dominion of the Mountain. While Strahd retains the power of the Mountain Fane, he is under the effect of a permanent nondetection spell. Additionally, Strahd can cast control weather as an action without components. 

Dominion of the Swamp. While Strahd retains the power of the Swamp Fane, he can cast major image and move earth without components. 

Dominion of the Forest. While Strahd retains the power of the Forest Fane, he can cast beast sense, locate creature, and animal shapes without components. Rejuvenation. If Strahd is destroyed while he retains the power of at least one of the Fanes, he gains a new body in 24 hours, regaining all his hit points and phases and becoming active again. His new body appears within his coffin. 

Vampiric Forbiddance 

When deciding whether and how Strahd's Forbiddance feature applies, use the following definitions: 

A residence is a place of residence that is not generally open to the public, including houses, apartments, cabins, and even certain types of rooms within a larger building, like an inn or church, provided they are used for living purposes and offer some degree of privacy. The definition does not include public places like taverns, shops, streets, or town squares. 

An occupant is an individual who expects to reside in the dwelling indefinitely, or a guest of such an individual. This person must have some claim to the space, such as by being a homeowner, renter, tenant, or guest of one of the aforementioned. 

Remember that an occupant charmed by the charm ability of Strahd’s Vampire phase will gladly invite him to enter if asked.

Dark Volley. Strahd conjures a rain of shadowy arrows to fall toward a point he can see within 120 feet. Each creature within a 10-foot radius, 40-foot-high cylinder centered on that point must make a DC 19 Dexterity saving throw, taking 18 (4d8) necrotic damage on a failure or half as much damage on a success.

It lasts until initiative count 20 on the following round or until a wind of moderate or greater speed (at least 10 miles per hour) disperses it. When the fog appears, Strahd can immediately take the Hide action as a reaction and move up to his speed.

The reduction lasts until the target finishes a long rest. 

Charm. One humanoid within 30 feet that Strahd can see must make a DC 19 Wisdom saving throw or be magically charmed for 1 minute or until Strahd loses his concentration (as if concentrating on a spell). 

A target that can't see Strahd automatically succeeds. While charmed, the target regards Strahd as a trusted friend to be heeded and protected; it isn't under Strahd's control, but takes his requests and actions in the most favorable way and lets Strahd bite it. 

The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on a success. If the target is still charmed at the end of the minute, the effect lasts for 24 hours, until Strahd is destroyed, or until he takes a bonus action to end it. 

Bonus Actions 

Bats’ Frenzy. Strahd summons a swarm of bat-like shadows from his cloak, forcing each creature within 10 feet to make a successful DC 19 Dexterity saving throw or take 15 (6d4) necrotic damage and gain disadvantage on the next attack roll it makes before the start of Strahd’s next turn. A creature that succeeds on the roll takes half damage and doesn’t gain disadvantage. 

Predator’s Fury. Strahd summons a pair of wolf-like shadows from his cloak and chooses up to two creatures he can see within 60 feet that are within 5 feet of each other. A target must succeed on a DC 19 Dexterity saving throw or take 16 (2d10 + 5) force damage and be knocked prone. A creature that succeeds on the roll takes half damage and isn’t knocked prone. 

Reactions 

Strahd can take up to three reactions per round, but only one per turn. 

Night’s Retreat. In response to taking damage, Strahd can fly up to his speed without provoking opportunity attacks. 

Blood Frenzy. In response to taking damage, Strahd can move up to his speed toward the attacker and make an unarmed strike attack. 

Lair Actions 

While Strahd is in Castle Ravenloft, he can take lair actions as long as he isn't incapacitated. On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), Strahd can take one of the following lair action options: 

Deluge of Blood. A wave of blood explodes outward from a point Strahd can see within 60 feet. Each creature within 10 feet of that point must make a DC 19 Strength saving throw. On a failure, a creature takes 7 (2d6) bludgeoning damage and is pushed 10 feet away from the point and knocked prone. The creature is also blinded until initiative count 20 on the next round. 

Wails of the Damned. Strahd summons an ethereal torrent of shrieking specters in a 5-foot radius centered on a point within 60 feet that he can see. Each creature in that area must make a DC 19 Wisdom saving throw or be frightened of Strahd until initiative count 20 on the next round. A creature frightened in this way is paralyzed and loses its concentration.

Design Notes: Strahd von Zarovich Roleplaying Strahd. The Gentleman, the Tyrant, and the Monster reflect three distinct popular community interpretations of Strahd's character. Many DMs will attempt to combine two or more of these archetypes into their campaign at a time, but doing so can risk making Strahd's character feel inconsistent and unpredictable. 

As such, this section provides a structured, methodical approach to developing Strahd's character through his relationship with the players. Importantly, each transition is tied to a particular point in the adventure's timeline, ensuring that Strahd does not, for example, spoil his relationship with the players before inviting them to dinner, or treat them as enemies before they have the capacity to defend themselves. 

Strahd's Relationships. This section preserves Strahd's canonical relationship with Ireena in order to keep his (cold, calculating, and sociopathic) characterization consistent. 

Strahd's Goals. This section is structured to ensure a high-tension, action-packed sequence of challenges from the beginning to the end of the campaign. Specifically, it explains: 

why Strahd does not simply seize Ireena from the players (he fears the Dark Powers’ intervention if he does not escape Barovia first); 

why Strahd’s forces are attacking St. Andral’s Church and the Wizard of Wines winery (he seeks to break the Barovians’ spirit to fuel his escape ritual); 

why Strahd does not assist his forces in defeating the players at St. Andral’s Church or the Wizard of Wines winery (he seeks to separate the weak from the strong); why Strahd “tests” the players instead of killing them (he wants to find generals for his future armies); 

why the players must reconsecrate the Fanes (they must stop Strahd from using them in his ritual and remove Strahd's immortality); 

why Strahd does not simply kill the players when they reconsecrate the Fanes (he seeks to use them as alternate conduits to the Fanes); 

why the players cannot bring an army of allies to Castle Ravenloft (they are preoccupied defending their homes from Strahd’s undead apocalypse); and 

why the players must confront Strahd at Castle Ravenloft (they must do so to end his undead apocalypse). 

Strahd's Allies. For reasons of both balance and narrative, it is important that Strahd faces the final fight alone. Strahd's Tactics. Strahd's original statblock is exceptionally fragile, allowing players to destroy him without the Sunsword as early as level 6. His phasing lair action, however, turns the original final battle into a torturous slog, ensuring that the players cannot win unless the Dungeon Master allows it or makes a mistake. 

Many substitute statblocks have been proposed, increasing Strahd's Challenge Rating beyond his original difficulty. However, these strengthened statblocks fail for two simple reasons: 

Any Strahd statblock that is powerful enough to survive the players' attacks for more than three rounds is also powerful enough to knock players unconscious with a single attack, thereby starting a "death spiral" that kills the entire party. 

Any Strahd statblock that is unable to knock players unconscious with a single attack is fragile and must rely on hit-and-run guerilla tactics instead, disappointing and frustrating players who had rightfully expected an epic confrontation. 

This issue can be solved by dramatically increasing Strahd's hit points and/or Armor Class (i.e., "Defensive Challenge Rating") while dramatically decreasing his attack bonus and/or damage output (i.e., "Offensive Challenge Rating"). These changes dramatically increase his lifespan without risking a TPK, ensuring a long, yet winnable boss battle 

Long battles, however, leave players exhausted and bored— especially for playgroups whose combats run slow. To inject energy and dynamism into the fight, we can split Strahd's statblock into three parts, or "phases," with each phase bestowing Strahd with new abilities and features. Each phase has been calibrated using Challenge Ratings 2.0 to survive approximately three to four rounds against an average 10th level party wielding the Sunsword and Holy Symbol of Ravenkind and accompanied by Ezmerelda d'Avenir, Ireena Kolyana, and [[Worlds/Barovia/NPCs/Kasimir Velikov\|Kasimir Velikov]]; the entire combat encounter should last nine to twelve rounds in total. 

To strengthen the themes of the final fight, each phase reflects a part of Strahd's history and descent into darkness: the Soldier (reflecting his history as a conqueror); the Mage (reflecting his search for immortality); and the Monster (reflecting his passage into undeath). 

Even with a multi-phase statblock, however, Strahd's battlefield remains relatively stagnant. To introduce additional tactics and dynamics into the fight, each of Strahd's phases have been given the following: two attack options (for moving enemies and imposing conditions, respectively); two bonus attack options (for punishing short and long-range foes, respectively); and two reaction options (for escaping and aggressing, respectively). 

Strahd's legendary actions have also been replaced with the ability to take multiple reactions per round, maintaining his ability to react to changing circumstances while reducing memory issues for the DM. 

Note that the Mage statblock intentionally foregoes a traditional "spellcasting" feature in favor of an action-oriented selection of spells. While some DMs might be disappointed by Strahd's lack of choice, it is important to remember that each phase will survive for only a short period of time; as such, Strahd's spells have been carefully curated in order to provide players with the most challenging, tactical, and memorable experience possible. 

Vampire Forbiddance. Tension is the key to horror, and monsters are therefore scary only when bound by meaningful rules. Permitting Strahd to enter any home simply because “he is the Land” removes the players’ ability to meaningfully prevent it, thereby removing a large amount of suspenseful gameplay. 

Moreover, a monster is only as resonant as its most notable weaknesses; a werewolf that cannot be killed with silver, for example, is hardly a werewolf at all. Removing Strahd’s Forbiddance destroys a key part of the horror fantasy: the ability to defy a monster using its unique rules and weaknesses. As such, this guide intentionally retains that feature.

Son of [[Worlds/Barovia/NPCs/Queen Ravenovia\|Queen Ravenovia]] van Roeyen and King Barov
Brother of [[Worlds/Barovia/NPCs/Sergei von Zarovich\|Sergei]]

Strahd von Zarovich, a vampire and wizard, has the statistics presented in appendix D. Although he can be encountered almost anywhere in his domain, the vampire is always encountered in the place indicated by the card reading later in this chapter, unless he has been forced into his tomb in the catacombs of Castle Ravenloft.
# **Description:**
Strahd believes his soul is lost to evil. He feels neither pity nor remorse, neither love nor hate. He doesn't suffer anguish or wallow in indignation. He believes, and has always believed, that he is the master of his own fate. When he was alive, Strahd could admit to letting his emotions get the better of him from time to time. Now, as a vampire, he is more monster than man, with barely a hint of emotion left. He is above the concerns of the living. The only event that occasionally haunts him is the death of [[Worlds/Barovia/NPCs/Tatyana Ivanova\|Tatyana]], but his view of the past is bereft of romance or regret. In his mind, her death couldn't have been prevented, and what is done cannot be undone. In life, Strahd lived to conquer. In undeath, he conquers still-not realms, but people, driving good souls to become corrupt and destroying those who won't yield. Characters who try to appeal to Strahd's humanity will be gravely disappointed, because there is little humanity left in him. If they ask Strahd why he's preying on Ireena Kolyana, he tells them that Ireena's body is the host for [[Worlds/Barovia/NPCs/Tatyana Ivanova\|Tatyana]]'s soul, and [[Worlds/Barovia/NPCs/Tatyana Ivanova\|Tatyana]]'s soul belongs to him. Strahd can be seductive and subtle when he chooses to be, especially if a person is clever or attractive. Men and women of beauty and cunning amuse Strahd for a time-playthings to possess or discard as he desires. If he senses a lack of cohesion in a party of adventurers, he preys on that weakness and tries to drive a wedge between the characters by promising to help one at the expense of another. If Strahd senses evil in a person, he cultivates that tendency by offering to turn that character into a full-fledged vampire after helping Strahd destroy the rest of the party. Ultimately, Strahd doesn't honor his promise, instead turning the character into a vampire spawn under his control.

# **Character History:**
In life, Strahd von Zarovich was a count, a prince, a soldier, and a conqueror. After the death of bis father, King Barov, Strahd waged long, bloody wars against his family's enemies. He and his army cornered the last of these enemies in a remote mountain valley before slaying them all. Strahd named the valley Barovia, after his deceased father, and was so struck by its scenic beauty that he decided to settle there. [[Worlds/Barovia/NPCs/Queen Ravenovia\|Queen Ravenovia]] lamented the death of Barov and was fearful of Strahd. War had made him cold and arrogant. She kept her younger son, [[Worlds/Barovia/NPCs/Sergei von Zarovich\|Sergei]], away from the battlefield. Strahd envied the love and attention his mother visited upon his brother, so in Barovia he remained. Peace made Strahd restless, and he began to feel like his best years were behind him.
<blockquote></Strong>
> I AM THE ANCIENT. I AM THE LAND. 
> My beginnings are lost in the darkness of the past.
> I am not dead. 
> Nor am I alive.
> I am undead, forever. 
[[Resources/Equipment/Books, Texts/Tome of Strahd\|Tome of Strahd]]

Unwilling to go the way of his father, Strahd studied magic and forged a pact with the Dark Powers of the Shadowfell in return for the promise of immortality. Strahd scoured his conquered lands for wizards and artisans, brought them to the valley of Barovia, and commanded them to raise a castle to rival the magnificent fortresses of his ancestral homeland. Strahd named the castle Ravenloft, after his mother, to demonstrate his Jove for her. When it was complete, Strahd commanded his mother and brother to come to Barovia and stay with him. [[Worlds/Barovia/NPCs/Sergei von Zarovich\|Sergei]] eventually took up residence at Raveoloft, but Ravenovia passed away while traveling to her namesake. In sorrowful disappointment, Strahd sealed his mother's body in a crypt beneath the castle. Strahd's attention soon turned to [[Worlds/Barovia/NPCs/Tatyana Ivanova\|Tatyana]], a young Barovian woman of fine lineage and remarkable beauty. Strahd believed her to be a worthy bride, and he lavished [[Worlds/Barovia/NPCs/Tatyana Ivanova\|Tatyana]] with gifts and attention. Despite Strahd's efforts, she instead fell in love with the younger, warmer [[Worlds/Barovia/NPCs/Sergei von Zarovich\|Sergei]]. Strahd's pride prevented him from standing in the way of the young couple's love until the day of [[Worlds/Barovia/NPCs/Sergei von Zarovich\|Sergei]] and [[Worlds/Barovia/NPCs/Tatyana Ivanova\|Tatyana]]'s wedding, when Strahd gazed into a mirror and realized he had been a fool. Strahd murdered [[Worlds/Barovia/NPCs/Sergei von Zarovich\|Sergei]] and drank his blood, sealing the evil pact between Strahd and the Dark Powers. He then chased [[Worlds/Barovia/NPCs/Sergei von Zarovich\|Sergei]]'s bride-to-be through the gardens, determined to make her accept and love him. [[Worlds/Barovia/NPCs/Tatyana Ivanova\|Tatyana]] hurled herself off a castle balcony to escape Strahd's pursuit, plunging to her death. Treacherous castle guards, seizing the opportunity to rid the world of Strahd forever, shot their master with arrows. But Strahd did not die. The [[Worlds/Barovia/Factions/Dark Powers\|Dark Powers]] honored the pact they had made. The sky went black as Strahd turned on the guards, his eyes blazing red. He had become a vampire. After slaughtering the guards, Strahd saw the faces of his father and mother in the thunderclouds, looking down upon him and judging him. He had destroyed the family bloodline and doomed all of [[Worlds/Barovia/Locations/Barovia\|Barovia]]. The castle and the valley were spirited away, locked in a demiplane surrounded on all sides by deadly fog. For Strahd and his people, there would be no escape.

Strahd has been the master of Ravenloft for centuries now. Since becoming a vampire, he has taken several consorts-none as beloved as [[Worlds/Barovia/NPCs/Tatyana Ivanova\|Tatyana Ivanova]], but each a person of beauty. All of them he turned into vampire spawn. Although he feeds on the hapless souls of Barovia, they provide little nourishment and no comfort. From time to time, strangers from faraway lands are brought to his domain, to play the vampire's game of cat-and-mouse. Strahd savors these moments, for though these strangers offer him no lands to conquer, they aren't so easily destroyed and therefore provide a welcome diversion. Strahd believes that the key to his escaping Barovia lies in finding someone worthy to rule in his stead, but his arrogance are so indomitable that no one is ever good enough in his eyes. He believes in his cold heart that only a von Zarovich as great as he or his father could sway the [[Worlds/Barovia/Factions/Dark Powers\|Dark Powers]] to release him..

# **Goals:**
Strahd has the following goals in the adventure. 
###### TURN IREENA KOLYANA 
Strahd's unrequited love for [[Worlds/Barovia/NPCs/Tatyana Ivanova\|Tatyana Ivanova]] drove him to slay his brother, [[Worlds/Barovia/NPCs/Sergei von Zarovich\|Sergei von Zarovich]]. Some time ago, Strahd glimpsed the young woman [[Worlds/Barovia/NPCs/Ireena Kolyana\|Ireena Kolyana]] in the village of Barovia and felt extreme deja vu. Ireena looked exactly like [[Worlds/Barovia/NPCs/Tatyana Ivanova\|Tatyana]]! Strahd now believes that Ireena is the latest reincarnation of [[Worlds/Barovia/NPCs/Tatyana Ivanova\|Tatyana]], and thus he seeks to claim her. Strahd's evil courtship has led him to visit Ireena twice. On both occasions, he charmed his way into her home-the house of her adopted father, the burgomaster of the village of Barovia-and drank her blood. He intends to kill Ireena during their next meeting and turn her into his vampire spawn consort. Chapter 3 gives details about Ireena and where to find her in the village of Barovia. 

###### FIND RUDOLPH VAN RIGHTEN 
Although he is usually focused on making [[Worlds/Barovia/NPCs/Ireena Kolyana\|Ireena Kolyana]] his bride, Strahd has been distracted by reports that a legendary vampire hunter named [[Worlds/Barovia/NPCs/Rudolph Van Richten\|Rudolph Van Richten]] has come to [[Worlds/Barovia/Locations/Barovia\|Barovia]]. It takes more than one old man with a death wish to frighten Strahd; nevertheless, the vampire has his spies searching [[Worlds/Barovia/Locations/Barovia\|Barovia]] for van Richten. Strahd would like very much to meet the old vampire hunter, lock him in the dungeons of [[Worlds/Barovia/Locations/Castle Ravenloft\|Castle Ravenloft]], and slowly break his spirit. Chapter 5 describes the town of Vallaki, where van Richten currently resides incognito. 

###### SEARCH FOR A SUCCESSOR OR CONSORT
Strahd can sense the a:rrival of new blood in his domain. When newcomers enter [[Worlds/Barovia/Locations/Barovia\|Barovia]], he shifts his attention from [[Worlds/Barovia/NPCs/Ireena Kolyana\|Ireena Kolyana]] and Van Richten to his new guests so that he can determine whether any of them is worthy to be his successor or consort. (Eventually, he decides that none of them can replace him as master of Barovia, but he doesn't arrive at this conclusion immediately.) 
Stra·hd pays close attention to adventurers who are charismatic and arrogant, like himself. He focuses his attacks on them, to see how much they can withstand. If they crumble easily, he loses interest in them. If they exhibit great fortitude and defiance, his interest is piqued-even more so if the character displays uncommon knowledge or beauty. Such a person might not be worthy to succeed him, but the man or woman might provide amusement to Strahd as a new possession.

 ### When Strahd Attacks
Strahd isn't a villain who remains out of sight until the final scene. Far from it-he travels as he desires to any place in his realm or his castle, and (from his perspective) the more often he encounters the characters, the better. The characters can and should meet him multiple times before the final encounter, which most likely takes place in the location determined by the card reading. When Strahd wants to terrorize the characters, he pays them a visit, either  under the cloak of night or beneath overcast skies during the day. If they're indoors, he tries to charm or goad a character into inviting him inside (along with his vampire spawn; if they are present). Strahd and his minions never attack Ireena. These encounters are meant to test the characters, not kill them. After a few rounds of toying with them, Strahd and his creatures withdraw. If the characters retreat, Strahd is likely to allow them to flee, savoring their fear and believing he has broken them.
