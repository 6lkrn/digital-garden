#### Blood of the Vine Tavern  

An old, chipped stone statue stands at the center of this town square, depicting a man wearing leather armor and holding a sword. 

The statue bears a weather-worn plaque at its base. It reads: “ISMARK ANTONOVICH THE GREAT. Burgomaster of Barovia. Bane of Vampires. 618—662 B.C.” (“B.C.” stands for “Barovian Calendar.”) 

You see a sign hangs askew above the doorway, proclaiming this to be the Blood on the Vine tavern. Originally named Blood **of** the Vine, the N has bee scratched over with an F. 

Much like the rest of the village, this is a shoddy establishment. A small fire in the hearth is trying its best to give warmth to the few huddled souls within. 

They include the barkeep, three Vistani sitting together, Mad Mary, [[Worlds/Barovia/NPCs/Vasili von Holz\|Vasili von Holz]], Doru and Ismark Kolyanovich. [[Worlds/Barovia/NPCs/Alenka\|Alenka]], [[Worlds/Barovia/NPCs/Mirabel\|Mirabel]], and Sorvia are merely patrons, visiting from Tser Pool to drink and gather news. 

When the players enter, these Vistani eye them with brief interest, but soon return to their drinks, departing the tavern soon after. As the PCs speak with Arik, they can hear an argument break out between Ismark and Doru. Doru says something and Ismark reels back as if struck, then his eyes crease with worry. He gives Mary his condolences, and promises that he will organize a search party as soon as the last one returns. Any player that gets a raise on their notice roll can hear the words "Ismark the Lesser."

Ismark storms out of the tavern. Doru apologises to Arik and offers to pay for everyones drinks. If they players approach Doru, Mary gives the players a pale, wide-eyed look, thanks Doru,  and departs swiftly through the door. Arik then delivers the players' drinks, and the taproom slowly fills once more with murmurs of conversation and the occasional clinks of tankards.
