Gwendolyn, the daughter of [[Worlds/Caermor/NPCs/Derion\|Derion]], is the girl whose disappearance prompted the hunting of [[Worlds/Caermor/NPCs/Albee\|Albee]]. Captured by [[Worlds/Caermor/NPCs/Mother Gloam\|Mother Gloam]]'s sleep spell only moments after leaving [[Worlds/Caermor/NPCs/Albee\|Albee]]'s rented cottage, she is now the prisoner of the summoned devil in a deserted chapel.

She is slated to be given to a coven member as a slave or else sacrificed to the glory of [Tiamat](Tiamat.md) if she becomes too difficult to control. Though few of the townsfolk admit it
(with the exception of [[Worlds/Caermor/NPCs/Lara\|Lara]]), Gwendolyn is a headstrong girl with a very good idea of what she wants. The locals see this as lack of respect, shaming her father [[Worlds/Caermor/NPCs/Derion\|Derion]]. Anyone pushing Gwendolyn in a direction she doesn't want to go is in for a fight. When (or if) she is rescued, she sets off at once to find [[Worlds/Caermor/NPCs/Albee\|Albee]].

While imprisoned by the devil, Gwendolyn has not been mistreated at all because [[Worlds/Caermor/NPCs/Dougal\|Dougal]] would like her as part of his spoils and does not want "damaged merchandise". But she has been kept bound and blindfolded. She cannot [[Identify\|Identify]] her captors by sight, but she has a 60% chance of identifying them by voice if she hears them speaks once she has been freed; the chance of identifying [[Worlds/Caermor/NPCs/Mother Gloam\|Mother Gloam]] as one of her captors is 90%. 

She has also been kept under the influence of [[Worlds/Caermor/NPCs/Mother Gloam\|Mother Gloam]]'s narcolepsy potion, The most recent dose of the potion will be effective for 6 + 1d6 turns after the characters find Gwendolyn. While imprisoned, Gwendolyn has been visited by [Trevus](Trevus.md), [Mother Gloam](Mother%20Gloam.md), and [[Worlds/Caermor/NPCs/Dougal\|Dougal]] (and has a chance of identifying their voices as listed above). She has not been visited by [MacHeath](MacHeath.md). If questioned by the characters, she mentions that the dragon often taunted her and that it mentioned something about its presence being at the will of “My Lady", “Her Majesty” or “The Princess".
