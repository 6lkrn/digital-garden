Running a Business - Revisited

There are three new special rules for businesses: steward, investment, and risk. Otherwise use the rules from page 129 of the Dungeon Master’s Guide. The goal of these rules is to make player character owned businesses an interesting and useful part of the game, but something that only comes into play about once a month (30 days). These rules also assume that there’s only one roll per business per month. Note that the starting expense is the amount of money required to purchase this business from someone else or build a new one from nothing.

NOTE: Some businesses may have varied or combined stats. A sailing ship that acts as a travelling theater may have even greater expenses and maintenance than a normal sailing ship. An inn that brews its own beer may have a higher maintenance cost..

  

Steward

A steward is a person you designate to handle the day to day management of the business. They are your main contact for this business and have a great influence on its success or failure by affecting rolls on the Risk table.

  

Investment

Investment is money spent on better maintenance, supplies, hirelings, advertising, insurance and other expenses that could potentially help a business. Every 1 gp spent adds 1 to the monthly roll on the Running a Business table. The maximum amount of gold that you can invest each month is equal to three days of maintenance (or one-tenth of the monthly maintenance cost).

  
  
  
  
  

Risk

Once per month, before rolling on Running a Business (DMG p.129) the DM rolls once on the Risk table for each business. Roll 1d20 and add the steward’s Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma modifiers to the roll and compare the total to the Risk table. The table results will either directly affect the amount of money gained or lost on the Running a Business table, or includes other strange, fantastic, dangerous, and fun events.
