Once the party starts to travel to and fro across the north and back, it would be a good idea to have the party be made aware of the Teleportation Circles, have a Harper give a Letter of Recommendation to give to [[Worlds/Faerun/NPCs/Krowen Valharrow\|Krowen Valharrow]] in [[Worlds/Faerun/Locations/Everlund\|Everlund]], and heâ€™ll make the circles available for the party.
