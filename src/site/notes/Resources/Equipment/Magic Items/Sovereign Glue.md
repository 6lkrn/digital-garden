Wondrous item, legendary 

This viscous, milky-white substance can form a permanent adhesive bond between any two objects. It must be stored in a jar or flask that has been coated inside with [[Campaign Resources/Equipment/Items/Magic Items/Oil of Slipperiness\|Campaign Resources/Equipment/Items/Magic Items/Oil of Slipperiness]]. 

When found, a container contains 1d6 + 1 ounces. One ounce of the glue can cover a 1-foot square surface. The glue takes 1 minute to set. Once it has done so, the bond it creates can be broken only by the application of [[Campaign Resources/Equipment/Items/Magic Items/Universal Solvent\|Campaign Resources/Equipment/Items/Magic Items/Universal Solvent]] or [[Campaign Resources/Equipment/Items/Magic Items/Oil of Etherealness\|Campaign Resources/Equipment/Items/Magic Items/Oil of Etherealness]], or- with a [[Campaign Resources/Magic/Spells/Wish\|wish]] spell.
