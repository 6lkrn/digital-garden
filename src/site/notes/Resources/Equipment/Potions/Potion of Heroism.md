Potion, rare

For 1 hour after drinking it, you gain 10 [[Campaign Resources/Rules/5e/Combat/Temporary Hit Points\|temporary hit points]] that last for 1 hour. 

For the same duration, you are under the effect of the [[Bless\|bless]] spell (no concentration required). 

This blue potion bubbles and steams as if boiling.
